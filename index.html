        <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="0" data-line-end="2">In this chapter there is an after party scene in Karias house (after Birthday Party)[27 August 2015]. Next day she got a photoshoot request from some Threads fashion company and on the very next day she went for the photoshoot for Threads fashion magazine, near Tadpole playground, in front of Boston Common Carousel. And there she met KARAM</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2" data-line-end="5">●   Matilda<br>
        ●   Pamela and Ruby<br>
        ●   Olima</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="6" data-line-end="7">August 27, 2015. Morning</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="8" data-line-end="9">Karia and her sister were cleaning up the mess that had been created from the birthday party last night. While collecting the party plates from the table, the whole last night birthday party flashes her mind.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="10" data-line-end="11">At 11:59PM, August 26. There were so many Facebook messages and YouTube comments on her recent video, wishing her a happy birthday as she was going through the messages her sister shoyeed from the living room “Karia, come outside baby. We have to prepare for the birthday party, Your friends are about to come”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="12" data-line-end="13">It was about 1:05 AM on the clock, and the doorbell rang. Karia opened the door. It was Pamela and her little sister Ruby, Matilda and Olima with gift wrapped boxes in their hands.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="14" data-line-end="15">The party started at 1:20 AM. They all were hooting so loud that Karia’s neighbour knocked at the door and asked politely to lower down the music and the hooting that they were making. The party goes on but now with no music and no hooting, only dancing.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="16" data-line-end="17">“Hey” Karia heard someone shout, it was her sister. Karia came back to the present day. “Clean up you lazy girl” Her sister laughs. They started cleaning birthday popper flakes and soon Karia realized that these tiny flakes are the biggest disaster in her life, she would never use the party poppers again.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="18" data-line-end="19">Later that day Karia got an email on her phone after she came out of the shower. At first she couldn’t see the message clearly, she squinted her eyes to have a look but she failed miserably. She ignored the message for a moment and went outside the room to eat something, “Mamma, do you know where my glasses are?” She shouts.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="20" data-line-end="21">“It should be in the kitchen, somewhere” Her mother replied. She found her spectacle, wore it and clicked the email. It was from Threads Fashion Company. There was a photoshoot request message.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="22" data-line-end="27">“Respected Madam,<br>
        We have gone through your pictures on instagram and they were stunning. In those pictures you have mentioned different company’s names.<br>

        Thankyou”</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="30" data-line-end="31">“Hello!  I am Lisa Francis from Channel 24, Boston news, Massachusetts”</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="32" data-line-end="33">“Tonight we have some new information about the most wanted vandal of Boston KARAM, or as some people say, the killer of nineteen years old teenager Karia Williams. In the past few days Olima Gerald, a victim of KARAM posted a video titled `` He is back on her youtube channel which got millions of views in a few days. Previously it was said that Kevin Anderson died, and he was supposed to be the real KARAM, but now Olima Gerald claims that Kevin Anderson cannot be KARAM. We are about to play a clip of her video, just after a short commercial break”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="34" data-line-end="35">Lisa stood up from her chair and walked outside the recording room, for something to eat and drink. On her way back to the recording room, she thought for a moment before saying it on camera, He is still alive… He must be a popular handsome guy.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="36" data-line-end="37">“Camera rolling” the camera guy shouts.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="38" data-line-end="40">“So we are back with the new… Olima claims that Kevin could not be KARAM. He is still alive and the reason for this is that someone is giving them tasks to complete, and it must be him because no one else has the control over the rings. If Kevin Anderson is not KARAM so who is he? Where is he? What is his motive?<br>
        Stay tuned for the updates, and thank you so much for watching. BYE”</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="41" data-line-end="42">“This KARAM guy is a big chaos”, Lisa whispered to herself.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="43" data-line-end="44">“That guy is a female hater. You should watch your steps back home” the camera guy jokes.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="45" data-line-end="46">“Blah, Blah, Blah Darrell” Lisa replied.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="47" data-line-end="48">Officer Hector Ross and officer Hanna Ortiz standing near the outer area of the Boston police department, talking about the recent news about KARAM. Hector is about to say something to Hanna but she is unable to hear a word because of the noise in the background. Hector gave her the sign to follow him as he walked towards his office, and Hanna followed him.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="49" data-line-end="50">“Did you or anyone in this department, search for anything related to Kevin Anderson?” Hector asked her.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="51" data-line-end="52">“Sir I have checked Kevin’s background” Hanna said, giving officer Hector the case file.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="53" data-line-end="54">“What did you get?” He asked, taking the file and sat down in his chair.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="55" data-line-end="56">“KARAM torture the girls and he is somehow realted to them, and he had motive. Kevin on other hand, who was considered to be KARAM, he is not even a little bit related to any of the girl, and Kevin dose not have any motive to torture these girls. There is nothing to hundred percent prove that Kevin Anderson is the real KARAM” She explained.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="57" data-line-end="58">“…Is Kevin and KARM, different? Why would he, Kevin torture these girls? What would be his motive?” Hanna Ortiz whispered to herself, she was getting confused.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="59" data-line-end="60">“He played us well. But how can he still be alive? I shot him myself” Hector said, stood up and started pacing back and forth in the office.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="61" data-line-end="62">&quot;He must have planted someone who looks like him, or the girls must have been lying for fake publicity. You should try to remember what happened that day. I mean everything,” the Hanna said, standing straight.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="63" data-line-end="64">Officer Hector didn’t say a word, just went to flash back.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="65" data-line-end="66">Hector Ross was walking back to the police department from a random coffee stall in Boston, Beacon street, holding a cup of coffee, and on his way back, he got a call.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="67" data-line-end="68">&quot;Hello! this is officer Hector speaking from the Boston police department,“ he said.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="69" data-line-end="70">“Hello officer this is Adam. I am calling from the Earl of Sandwich, in the park. There is someone following us. He is going to hurt one of the girls with me. Please come here right now”</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="71" data-line-end="72">“I’ll be there, don’t worry” He replied</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="73" data-line-end="74">“I remember clearly, there was a man in the back jacket. He ran towards the Parkman Bandstand… I shouted, stop but he didn’t so I shot him, and he died right in front of me and so many people” Hector talks out loud, thinking.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="75" data-line-end="78">“Who is this Adam? Where is he?” Hannah asked.<br>
        “I don’t know actually. I saw his face but I remember anything about him. I was in a hurry to catch that guy” Hector said, Hannah put him in a big confusion.<br>
        “You should check your phone. If he called you there must be his number in your phone” Hannah said, still standing straight in the same place as before.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="79" data-line-end="80">“Yah! Right” Hector took out his phone and scrolled down to the same date of that incident. “There you go. That is his number. He is the only one who calls me that day” Hector handed the phone to Hannah, without telling her what to do with it.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="81" data-line-end="82">“I have a question sir” Hannah asked, taking the phone in her hand, she was confused.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="83" data-line-end="84">“Yes! What’s the question”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="85" data-line-end="86">“How did he call you on your personal cell phone? Where did he get your number?” Hannah asked, finally moved from her fixed spot, “… and what should I do with this phone?”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="87" data-line-end="88">“Wait a second… You are right. How did he get my number and why did he call me on my cell phone” Hector got confused again. He grabs his phone from her hand and rushes outside. Hannah created too much confusion for him.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="89" data-line-end="90">Officer Hector sprinted towards the cyber department. He gave them the phone, “trace this number 617 555 0144 fast”. He wants to verify the number, to check if it belongs to Adam or not. He walked outside to get some air.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="91" data-line-end="92">“How did I not remember his face?” Hector talks to himself. Now he has the option to wait for the call trace or he can go ask the girls about Adam.</p>
        <hr>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="94" data-line-end="95">Around forty minutes later a man tapped Hector’s shoulders when he was sitting on the bench outside the police department.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="96" data-line-end="97">“There you go sir. The number belongs to Adam Walter, the who” The man said.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="98" data-line-end="99">“Okay thanks” Hector said to the man. He dialed that number to check if that number actually belongs to Adam or not. “Hello! I am officer Hector Ross from the Boston police department. Am I talking to Adam Walter”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="100" data-line-end="101">“You are talking to the right person. What do you want?” He replied with an inaudible laugh.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="102" data-line-end="103">“I need to ask you a question Mr.Adam”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="104" data-line-end="107">“Yes of course. I love questions”.<br>
        .<br>
        “Okay! So tell me the guy who died that day, Kevin Anderson. The guy in the news”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="108" data-line-end="109">“Yes officer Hector I know that. What do you want to know from me about Kevin” Adam asked politely.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="110" data-line-end="111">“I just want to ask, what do you think about Kevin Anderson? Is he the real KARAM, or is KARAM still out there in Boston?”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="112" data-line-end="113">“If you believed what Olima said in the video, yes KARAM is still out there somewhere, and if you believe that you shot him dead then yes, KARAM is dead” Adam took a breath, “He being dead or alive is not the matter, you have to protect the girls, until it is proved that KARAM is actually dead… One last thing officer”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="114" data-line-end="115">“Yes what?” Officer Hector stood up, he got curious.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="116" data-line-end="117">“KARAM died with the Karia’s suicide”. After this officer Hector said, “what are you talking about”, but Adam had canceled the call right away, and now his phone is not reachable when Hector dialed his number again.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="118" data-line-end="119">After the call with hector, Adam went to the flash back, to the time when the Kevin incident had happened.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="120" data-line-end="121">April 8, 2019, Monday morning.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="122" data-line-end="123">Adam decided to build his trust on the girls. He hired the kidnapper from the dark web. He gave some instructions to the kidnapper. How should he be dressed? What will be the location? What will be the time? And who would he kidnap.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="124" data-line-end="125">The same day of planning and hiring the kidnapper. Adam calls all the girls to be at the Earl of Sandwich in the park at 5:30 PM. There they will discuss the security measure to be safe from KARAM, and will find a way to catch him.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="126" data-line-end="127">It was a dark night that day, and soon it would be darker. Adam saw a man spying on them near the tennis court, he was dressed exactly the same as KARAM. Adam waited and waited for the right moment, making Edon drink more and more so she would go to the restroom. His plan worked.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="128" data-line-end="129">Around 5:50 PM Edon decided to go to use the restroom. The same time Adam walked away for a private call. He took out an old sony ericsson flip phone and called officer Hector on his cell phone.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="130" data-line-end="131">The man walks slowly towards Edon, as he was supposed to do. He tries to chloroform her. He failed. A sound was heard by both of them, “Don’t move. You are under arrest” officer Hector shouts, with his gun pointed towards him. The Kidnapper ran towards the Parkman, Bandstand. It’s easier for him to hide somewhere in the dark. The rain had started, and it was making the ground look like a lake, which created difficulty for him to run. As he reached closer to the bandstand, officer Hector shouted,”Stop it, or I’ll shoot”. Rain is also creating difficulty for him to listen to the clear sound of what the officer Hector was saying.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="132" data-line-end="133">Officer had shot the bullet, and it hit the kidnapper in the middle of the skull from the back. He fell down on his face, motionless, and the blood was getting washed away in the rain.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="134" data-line-end="136">The group of girls standing a few meters away from the dead body, holding hands and standing close to each other. Edon was getting curious and she went closer to the body. “Your game is over” She whispered. She tried to check his identity, but officer Hector said ”don’t touch the body”. “I just want to see his face and ID card,” Edon asked Politely.<br>
        Officer turned the body over and took out his wallet to show the ID to the girl, “Kevin Anderson” Edon read aloud his name.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="137" data-line-end="139">The Police Department part 3<br>
        “Did you find out who Adam is?” Hannah asked as she saw Hector wandering outside on the bench of the police department.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="140" data-line-end="141">“He is Adam Walter… We have to meet him in person. I think he knew something about KARAM. You go and get the address of this number” Hector ordered her, giving her his phone.</p>
        <hr>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="144" data-line-end="145">They reached the location of the number. It was an old rusty apartment with the name Adam W Walter, engraved in the wall. Hannah rang the doorbell. An old man came out from inside, coughing.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="146" data-line-end="147">“Hello sir. Is this Adam Walter’s house? Is he here?” Hannah asked politely.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="148" data-line-end="149">“There is no Adam here, he died twenty years ago in a car accident” The man replied, closing the door on their face.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="150" data-line-end="151">“If he died twenty years ago, who did I talk to?” Hector said to himself.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="152" data-line-end="153">“It must be a phone number cloning. You have been talking to KARAM” Hannah said, shocked.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="154" data-line-end="155">“He played with us again” Hector felt the shock.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="156" data-line-end="158">Back on their way to the police department, Hector gave Hannah orders to search for Adam Walter, but without telling anyone about this incident. If they tell anyone about this, it would make people question their ability to solve any case.<br>
        After the breaking news of Olima’s videos against KARAM being back, the Massachusetts government decided to provide the safety to all seven of them. Each girl is provided with an individual female guard who will be with them twenty four seven. These guards were the information providers for the police, more than guarding the body.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="159" data-line-end="160">There is a private company FPG, which provides protection for females all around the United States of America. FPG is a Female Protection group, and it provides seven female guards to these girls.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="161" data-line-end="162">Matilda Harris will be guarded by Charlotte. Libby Butler will be guarded by Monica. Edon Matthew will be guarded by Julia. Mary Raymond will be guarded by Olivia. Josephine Edler will be guarded by Alice. Pamela Smith will be guarded by Jessica. Olima Gerald will be guarded by Venta.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="163" data-line-end="164">Actually these guards don’t have full names, and even their first names were fake for the purpose of hiding their personal information.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="165" data-line-end="166">Now the girls cannot go anywhere without their guards. They cannot meet anyone without the person being checked, unless the person is a parent or a sibling by blood, and some more weird rules. These rules were meant to be for their safety. Only Libby and Mary have their issues, they don’t want a shadow to be with them all the time.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="167" data-line-end="168">Whenever the task is given to them, they are forced to do it. Everytime the guards stop them from doing the task, the girls simply hold hands with their guards, and they both get shocked. The next time guards only watch them doing the weird task thing, and just give the information of their action to the police.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="169" data-line-end="170">The guards and the girls became friends after spending some time together.  Olima and Venta were like sisters to each other, they shared secrets with each other, they talked all the time. Mary and Libby are not friendly at all. They hate their guards and try to avoid them whenever possible. They never speak to them, except for replying to their weird questions.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="171" data-line-end="172">Confusion, Irritation and anger. There is a lot of stuff going on inside KARAM’s head. He can’t understand why Maedrian was not picking up the calls, and why she is not answering the text messages. Something is strange, but what? It was in this conflict that the fire was raging for him.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="173" data-line-end="174">There is only one thing he can think off now. He decided to give Maedrian a surprise visit, and he did. Later that day he knocked on her door and as he thought, Maedrain opened it.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="175" data-line-end="176">“Hello sir. Come inside… What made you come to my home?” She asked, smiling. She is wearing the kitchen apron, covered in corn flour.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="177" data-line-end="178">“Come here” KARAM dragged her to the corner, “This ring matter is getting out of hand… Why are the rings still working?”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="179" data-line-end="180">“I’ve checked sir. There is nothing wrong with the configuration of the rings”</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="181" data-line-end="182">“So… What’s happening? Who is controlling them?”</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="183" data-line-end="184">“No sir. There is no one…” Maedrian paused, “I saw Olima’s video. She was lying. It must be a trick of her to get you out in public”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="185" data-line-end="186">“How can that be possible? They all saw me die. I mean Kevin Anderson”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="187" data-line-end="188">“It must be a public stunt then. You should become Adam and ask her yourself. I know you will find something useful…. And please don’t go back home. I am making cake. You should try it” Maedrian walked towards the kitchen.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="189" data-line-end="192">Becoming Adam again looks good to KARAM. Now this is the only thing he thinks he can do to confirm what Olima said in her video.<br>
        “Okay. I like your idea. I will wait for a few days and we will see if there is anything important to discover about this whole mess… Thank you Maedrian. Have a nice day” KARAM said, giving her a kiss on the cheek. He walked away from there with confusing thoughts running through his mind.<br>
        He want to end this mess as soon as possible.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="193" data-line-end="194">Everything that happened tomorrow evening, Karia wanted it to be out of her mind. She was afraid of thinking about that man in the black jacket but the main thing was not that. The disturbing thing for her was the words, “You guys will pay for what you did”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="195" data-line-end="196">What did we do? And who are we in this whatsoever matter? “Who else is involved and what is that thing that we have to pay for?” Karia blankly talked to herself. There was no one in the house for the moment. Karia went outside and locked the door. She went straight to Ziggy’s Cafe. Between her first coffee order she called Olima and Libby to join her.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="197" data-line-end="198">Right after five minutes since Karia called them, they were standing in front of her. “I wanna tell you guys that tomorrow I have a photoshoot.” Karia said, with a straight face. “Ooh, That’s nice. Congrats” both said in unison. “Thanks guys but the thing is that there was a guy in black jacket. He warned me. He said that we have to pay for something…” Karia took a pause and continued “now I don’t understand who we are? And what did we do?”</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="199" data-line-end="200">“He is KARAM. He did the same thing with us but through the screen…” Olima said. “And we have to be careful. If we do anything wrong He’s gonna punish us for something mysterious that we did” Libby completes Olima’s sentence. This KARAM talk goes on for about an hour.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="201" data-line-end="202">Later when they were on their third coffee mug, Karia got a text message from her sister. “I am with mom and we will come home late” and another message ”you go home and lock the door or go to the sleepover with your friend, or do the opposite call them to the sleepover. Take care. BYE”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="203" data-line-end="204">Karia asked Olima and Libby “Can you guys come to sleepover with me. My mom and sister will be late today and I’ll be home alone by myself”. “Yah sure. I am just gonna text my mom” both replied in unison.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="205" data-line-end="206">Karia opened the door and when the light went on they all saw someone sitting on the sofa, one leg over the other…</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="208" data-line-end="209">“I need to find him.” Olima said to Venta, who was watching outside the window.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="210" data-line-end="211">“Find him… Who?” Venta asked in curiosity.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="212" data-line-end="213">“KARAM. We… I mean, we girls don’t have his face, but we can find Saphira’s information, and from there we might find some clue, related to real KARAM” Olima told her the whole story.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="214" data-line-end="217">“I don’t allow you to get yourself in danger. I am here to protect you” Venta ordered her, like a big sister.<br>
        .<br>
        “Please, Please…. And I am not doing this all by myself. You will be with me, all the time, and other girls and their guards will be with us” Olima said, with a pleased face.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="218" data-line-end="219">“Okay. But you have to tell me each and everything you guys are going to do” Venta gave her order.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="220" data-line-end="221">“Okay Boss” Olima hugged her. They both giggled.</p>
        <hr>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="224" data-line-end="225">“Can you track, or get information about Saphira? Or do you know someone who can do this?” Pamela got a text message from Olima.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="226" data-line-end="227">“What do you want to do with that? What is your plan?” Pamela replied, confused.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="228" data-line-end="229">“Come to my home right now. I will tell you the whole scene” Olima replied with a smiley face emoji.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="230" data-line-end="231">Around 6 PM in the evening, Pamela, Jessica, Olima and Venta were sitting in the living room of Olima’s apartment, listening to Olima’s plan carefully. According to Olima, her plan was foolproof and perfect.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="232" data-line-end="233">“Listen carefully. If we can find Saphira’s data somehow, then from there we can find a way to reach the real KARAM, not Kevin Anderson” Olima said, smiling.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="234" data-line-end="235">Olima’s mind, without any proof confirms that Kevin and KARAM are two different human’s. Now the only purpose of her life was to find him and ask him why he was not leaving them? Why is he not getting peace even with the death of Karia?</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="236" data-line-end="237">“I can do that. I know her best friend Maddie. She can help us. I will ask her online” Pamela agreed with Olima’s plan.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="238" data-line-end="239">Olima took out her phone, “Give me her email” She asked Pamela.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="240" data-line-end="241">“Cool down girl, let me find it” Pamela searched Maddie’s email, and around thirty five minutes of searching they finally found the email and Olima started typing the email.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="242" data-line-end="243">To: <a href="mailto:missmaddie779@mail.com">missmaddie779@mail.com</a></p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="244" data-line-end="245">Hey!</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="246" data-line-end="247">I am Olima Gerald from Boston Westview college. You don’t know me, and believe me you don’t want to know me either. I really need your help.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="248" data-line-end="249">Saphira… I don’t know the surname. She was your best friend. I want to ask you only one thing. Do you know something about her that can help us find her? I have something that belongs to her.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="250" data-line-end="251">Please reply.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="252" data-line-end="254">Take care<br>
        Olima</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="256" data-line-end="257">They all saw him sitting on the couch, one leg over the other, both hands behind the head. They knew that he was KARAM, without any second guess. Olima and Libby were shocked and seeing him on her couch left Karia’s jaw drop.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="258" data-line-end="259">“You guys want to see me so bad. Your wishes are my order mams. I am right in front of you. What are you guys gonna do now?” KARAM said, smiling. “What are you saying? We never want to see you” Libby said, fumbling. “Ooh…you little **. Never act smart with me, or else you will regret everything that happens in your life” KARAM said, this time with a straight face.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="260" data-line-end="261">“Hey see what I got” KARAM had Karia’s personal diary in his hand, Karia was shocked to see her most personal thing in his hands. “Should I tell them your….” KARAM saw a worried look on Karia’s face, then he continued “Dear Olive…. Olive must be the name of this diary, right?”. “Give it back. It’s personal” Karia shouted. “Ooh. You angry little cat….You never told your viewers about this Dear Olive. Let me read it for your friends….” KARAM laughed as he continued reading the passage from her diary. “Stop. I said give it back. It’s personal” Karia shouted again. “Your diary is already on the internet. Go and check yourself. It’s getting viral” KARAM smirked.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="262" data-line-end="263">“THIS IS CALLED HUMILIATION” KARAM said this line like he was trying to give them some kind of hint. He left the apartment. Libby ran right after him to talk, She understood what KARAM was trying to convey.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="264" data-line-end="265">“What the hell happened, and why did Libby run away” Olima said, confused. “I think she was scared of him and ran away,” Karia said, grabbing her diary from the couch.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="266" data-line-end="267">“Hey karam, wait. I want to talk” Libby said from upstairs. “Ooh so u wanna talk?.. Okay, let’s talk. Spit the shit out, hurry” KARAM said in a serious tone. “I know who you are?” Libby continued to talk. “Okay. Anything else, or should i leave now” KARAM was getting mad out of blue. “No no no, wait…” after a pause, she said ”you said the same line I said to someone… you are somehow related to her” Libby said, normally. “I am… I will make you guys feel the pain” Karam snatched her neck to bring her close and said this in her ear. He walked downstairs, a car was waiting for him.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="268" data-line-end="269">The time was around 6:28 PM when KARAM and Libby left. Olima and Karia decide to go to the police. Karia was afraid because they had no proof but Olima as usual, never agrees on anything against her decision. She took Karia with her to the police station.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="270" data-line-end="271">They both stopped right in front of Hector Ross’s table. “Sir there was an attack on us, again by KARAM” Olima said, in a single breath. “Okay madam. I will go and check the CCTV footage. You guys sat down, I’ll be back in a moment” Hector said, politely.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="272" data-line-end="282">After fifteen minutes, officer Hector approaches them with the laptop in his hands. “See mam there is the online car that approached the building right before you guys come, and this car belongs to Mr,Gerald…Listen madam there is no KARAM” He said, and continued “We can help you find him. You have to tell the sketch artist what he looks like, and we will go and find him”.<br>
        He had a keen eye on every move of these girls. She listened to every word Olima said, and she did not want them to execute whatever was going on in their mind. There is something fishy going on, she wanted to keep these girls away from Saphira.<br>
        If they got information about Saphira, they could somehow find and catch the real KARAM. The problem was not that they could find the real KARAM, even if they were able to find him, it wouldn’t stop her from her evil plans.<br>
        There was something going on, which is even hidden from herself at the moment.<br>
        For now, there were guards twenty four seven with these girls and because of this the fake KARAM is getting furious. She can’t execute her evil plan, and now if they got information about Saphira and that information goes public, it would create chaos for her.<br>
        She decided to somehow increase the shock power of the rings, she can’t, it is set at a particular range. She stood up and walked outside in the streets of Boston to get some fresh air, and to find a new idea for her evil plan.<br>
        Sitting on a bench inside a park, she thinks for a moment. “I know what they are saying. I know where they were all the time, so… so I should make them go to a place where they were away from their guards for some time…. And within that time I will do something with them” She spoke to herself.<br>
        She made a nice plan, but not every nice plan is executable. She knows the plan but doesn’t know what to do with it, it is just like a brilliant novel idea which is never written down. She wanted to use the rings to get rid of the guards, but she knew it wouldn’t be an easy task.<br>
        The problem was how to execute the plan? She needed help from someone who has a high level of intelligence, a person with a mind and power like KARAM. She had mind, and now she needs power.<br>
        Sitting on the stairs of her apartment building, Karia was reading the messages of the mess that KARAM had created for her. Everyone was talking trash about her, making fun of her. She still doesn’t understand why she was in this situation, why KARAM did that to her?</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="283" data-line-end="284">Few moments later she stood up and called Libby. “Hey! Why did you run away tomorrow?.. Do you know what happened? What the hell KARAM was talking about?” Karia asked Libby, in a bossy tone. “I don’t know how, but he was somehow related to Saphira…” Libby said, Karia cut her off, “How can you say that. Are you sure about that?” Karia was shocked.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="285" data-line-end="286">“You remember when he said, THIS IS CALLED HUMILIATION… It is the same thing we said to Saphira in the locker room… I cannot talk about that on the phone, can we guys meet somewhere?” Libby said, there was a stammer in her tone. “Just be ready. We will meet at ziggy. I’ll call the girls. Be there at six, sharp” Karia ordered.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="287" data-line-end="288">Around 6:10PM all seven of them reached the cafe. The cafe was one third filled, excluding them. They all sat on the last couch in the corner of the cafe where no one can suspect them. They were all afraid of KARAM. All of them had some idea about what they did.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="289" data-line-end="290">“Guys listen? I am going to tell you something important. Just listen and don’t say anything” Libby said, she was about to start the speech of the day when they did something wrong.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="291" data-line-end="292">He was somehow related to Saphira. He is definitely not her boyfriend because I heard his voice, it can not be Josh. And Josh didn’t have the guts to break into anyone’s house, Josh was a pussy. Josh was the same height as mine. KARAM was taller than me, about six feet and two or three inches tall.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="293" data-line-end="294">When I was talking to KARAM, I could see in his eyes. He will do what he said, he will make us pay for what we did. I said sorry to him, but he walked away. I don’t know how but he will definitely make us pay for our mistake.  What can we do now?</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="295" data-line-end="296">“We can go to the police. We don’t have any other options” Pamela said. “I went to the police several times. He was too smart, he took my car whenever he was around the town in the CCTV camera range. For the police, there was no KARAM” Olima replied, with a sad face. “…we went to the police station tomorrow. We have to protect our own selves. Police won’t help” Karia completed Olimas statement. They don’t know what could happen to them. They decided to go home and wait for his next move. They need to make a plan because sorry wouldn’t work.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="297" data-line-end="299">About a month had passed and there was no sign of KARAM. It was a good time for girls. The girls thought that he forgot about them, or it was a stupid prank that someone played with them. On the same day, the girls got a message from Stanplex hotels for a trip to Orlando, Florida, for a meet and greet with their fans.<br>
        After the morning shower Maedrian opened her laptop to check her emails. While surfing through emails she thought of checking the database of rings. If rings are still working, there must be some updates in the database.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="300" data-line-end="301">She opened the database to check the record. She was shocked when she opened it. The last active record was three days before Karia’s suicide. KARAM had deactivated the rings from the remote, and now there was only one way to activate the rings.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="302" data-line-end="303">The only way to activate the rings is possible if it is done by the system from which the rings are connected, “If I didn’t do it, so… who did it?” Maedrian thought.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="304" data-line-end="305">Some strange thoughts were running through her mind, everything is weird for her at this moment. After a while, she calls KARAM, “Sir, can you meet me at home? I have an important thing to say to you”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="306" data-line-end="307">“What is so important that you remembered at this moment?” KARAM asked, anxious.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="308" data-line-end="309">“I can’t tell you on the phone, you have to come to my house right now. It is so important” Maedrian said in a hurry.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="310" data-line-end="311">“Okay, Okay. Calm down, don’t worry. I am going to be at your house soon” KARAM canceled the call.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="312" data-line-end="313">KARAM opened the window and looked outside, towards the direction of Maedrians house. “What is so important? The only possible thing is that she might have found something related to the fake KARAM. What else it could be?” he thought.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="314" data-line-end="315">When KARAM arrived at Maedrian’s home, he rang the doorbell many times but no one opened the door, “Come on, Maedrian, please open the door”. He decided to go back, but as move one step towards the road, Maedrian opened the door from behind, “Come inside sir… and sorry I was in the bathroom”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="316" data-line-end="317">Inside the living room Maedrian put the laptop in front of KARAM, to show him the ring’s activity. “See this sir”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="318" data-line-end="319">“What?” He asked, curious.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="320" data-line-end="321">“If the rings are still active, as Olima said in her video. There must be something changed in the database, but nothing has changed. The last active date is when you deactivate the rings from the remote” Maedrian said all this in a single breath.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="322" data-line-end="323">“You said that Olima must have been lying,” KARAM questioned.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="324" data-line-end="325">“Yaa I know. I’ve checked. I have tapped their phones. There is definitely someone giving them commands”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="326" data-line-end="327">“You should trace where the commands are coming from?”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="328" data-line-end="329">“No sir. I made the system so I know the location of the commands are not traceable… and one thing sir. Whoever this fake KARAM is, He or She gonna kill these girls”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="330" data-line-end="331">“How can you say that?”</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="332" data-line-end="333">“See this sir. The first command that fake KARAM said was, OBEY ME OR ELSE YOU WILL BE KILLED”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="335" data-line-end="336">The Shock Rings</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="337" data-line-end="338">Throwing and catching the paper weight, and walking around the room, KARAM was lost in his thoughts. ”What happened sir?.. You look worried?” Maedrian asked politely. “Yes I am,” He replied. “Can I ask sir, why are you worried? What happened?” She asked in confusion.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="339" data-line-end="340">“There must be a way to have full control over these girls. I need to make them my slaves. If they disobeyed me, they would regret it. But…” KARAM took a long pause and said “How can this be done? There must be some way”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="341" data-line-end="343">“I have an idea. A foolproof idea” Maedrian smiled. “See this sir. It is a prototype of a ring. It will work fine as I planned…” Mandarin said. She was interrupted by KARAM as she was explaining the qualities of the rings. “Wait Wait. This ring? A foolproof plan?.. Are you serious?” KARAM got confused. “Listen sir. You will not regret it” she said. “Okay. Continue” He said, still confused.<br>
        “So…” She started the ring presentation.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="344" data-line-end="345">“This ring blinks whenever the person who wears it gets a message, or order in this case. And there will be a remote, connected to the rings. If they disobey, you press the button, and it will give them an electric shock”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="346" data-line-end="347">“Ring?..Are you serious? You think they don’t know how to take it off. They are not that stupid” KARAM said, sarcastically. “There is the fun part here sir. If the ring is on their fingers, they can not take it off by themselves. If they try to break the ring, They get a shock” She smiled. “Wait… what? You said shock… If they die?.. I am not a murderer” KARAM was still confused.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="348" data-line-end="350">“The shock is just for the torture. It works like a whip. If they disobey, they get hurt. The shock is not high enough to kill them” Maedrian replied, still smiling.<br>
        The next day morning after Olima’s email to Maddie. She got a reply back from her.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="351" data-line-end="352">Hello!</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="353" data-line-end="354">I am Maddie Summers. It is really nice of you to ask me for your help, and I am really happy for you.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="355" data-line-end="356">You are asking me about my best friend Saphira K Andrew. I can’t tell you the whole detailed stuff about her, there is not much cheezy about her to tell you, she is a simple girl. She was an open book, a nerdy innocent girl.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="357" data-line-end="358">In college Saphira was married to a guy named Keith Andrew. Before her marriage and some time after her marriage Saphira got depressed about something. She started getting panic attacks. She never told me why these attacks happened?</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="359" data-line-end="360">Months before her suicide she was going to a private psychiatist in Boston. I don’t know the name of that clinic.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="361" data-line-end="362">The rest is a mystery. Thank you.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="363" data-line-end="364">Peace</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="365" data-line-end="366">MissMaddie</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="367" data-line-end="368">“Saphira K, and Keith. Now who is this Keith person” Olima was shocked looking at the names. She passes the phone to Venta to read the email.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="369" data-line-end="370">&quot;Private psychiatrist… In Boston. How can someone get that depressed? ‘’ Venta whispered, “I think I know where this clinic is… There is only one private psychiatric clinic in Boston. My aunt runs it”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="371" data-line-end="372">“We might find something about KARAM there. Let’s go. Hurry” Olima and Venta run towards the clinic. They messaged others to be there.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="373" data-line-end="374">“Okat let’s go” Venta tapped Olima’s shoulder.</p>
        <hr>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="377" data-line-end="378">Around 7:30 PM, they both reached the clinic and started asking some questions. The receptionist knew Venta so she didn’t hesitate to give them the records of the patients. They wanted to find a little clue related to KARAM.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="379" data-line-end="380">Olima got her hands on Saphira K Andrews, and under the husband section there was a long name, Keith Andrew Revera Antonio Martine. “Keith is the actual KARAM. He planted Kevin, so everyone would think he died” Olima was shocked to see the name.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="381" data-line-end="382">“Do you have any clue about who this Keith Andrew is?” Venta asked the receptionist.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="383" data-line-end="384">“Yes. In the news when Kevin Anderson died, there was a person standing next to officer Hector. That man is Keith.” She replied.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="385" data-line-end="386">“That man was Adam…” Olima thought, but didn’t say a word, she paused for a moment, “So for all this time Adam was with us”. After a long series of thoughts Olima said, “Let’s go back home Venta”…</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="387" data-line-end="388">Karia’s confession</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="389" data-line-end="390">The very next day, since the girls got the message for meet and greet in Orlando, Florida. Karia was reading something on her laptop, legs folded, sitting on the floor in her room. Her sister Jamie came closer to her and saw her crying. Jamie snatched the laptop to see if someone was harassing her, but it was nothing other than the meet and greet message.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="391" data-line-end="392">“It is a good thing. You guys should go. Are you crying for this? Or there is something that you are hiding” Jamie asked, looking at her. “I don’t wanna go,” Karia said, sobbing. “Tell me what happened, or I am gonna slap you” Jamie ordered her to speak.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="393" data-line-end="394">“Okay, okay I am going to tell you everything but please don’t tell mom, she would get worried” Karia said in a low voice. “Okay! I promise” Jamie agreed.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="395" data-line-end="396">“There was a guy named KARAM. He posted my secret diary all over the internet… Now everyone is making fun of me” Karia paused for so long, looking down at the floor. “As***. But why would he do that? Everything happens for a reason” Jamie thought something for a moment, “Lets go to the police”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="397" data-line-end="398">“We cannot go to the police, for two reasons” Karia said. “But why? How can we let him go, and what the hell are those two reasons?” Jamie asked.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="399" data-line-end="400">“My friends and I did something with his wife. I don’t know who else was involved in this thing. I Libby and Olima bully Saphira everyday. We tortured her to the level which made her taking her own life. She’s a kindergarten teacher, and the worst thing is that we even torture her in front of kids aswell. She was a good girl, she never fought back, just cried and ran away” Karia confesses that she was involved in the suicide of Saphira.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="401" data-line-end="402">“And what’s the second reason?” Jamie asked again, staring at her. She said ”He uploaded the pictures from my identity, I cannot prove to the police that he did it. And for them, there is no KARAM”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="404" data-line-end="405">She walked towards the balcony of an under construction hotel in Boston, she took out a 7.62×51mm M24 sniper rifle and pointed it towards the psychiatric clinic. She started searching for Olima through the scope of the refile.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="406" data-line-end="407">She waited and waited for a long time. She knew that Olima would be here at this time. It was obvious that she was following her for a long time, and now Olima would be no more to be followed. Just a few more minutes, and the crime would happen once more in Boston.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="408" data-line-end="409">Olima and Venta walked out of the clinic and now they both were in the range of the scope, but Venta was not the target of fake KARAM, she only wanted to shoot Olima.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="410" data-line-end="411">Olima was walking happily because she found a clue that would lead her to KARAM. Soon she got to the center of the plus sign of the scope. Now it was just the click of the trigger. She pointed the plus sign on Olima’s forehead and pressed the trigger.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="412" data-line-end="413">Boom. It was a headshot. Olima fell down, motionless right in front of Venta, and she couldn’t do anything.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="414" data-line-end="415">The fake KARAM laughed and she ran away safely right after she executed her evil plan.  She had done exactly what she wanted to do.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="416" data-line-end="417">Venta looked back at Olima’s body lying on the footpath. She was shocked, anyone could have been shocked seeing a person dying right in front of them. For Venta, she just lost a sister.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="418" data-line-end="419">“KARAM will never escape from me. I’ll hunt you till the end” screamed Venta as she put Olima’s head in her lap.</p>
        <hr>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="422" data-line-end="423">It was late at night when the police arrived at the scene. They saw Venta holding the dead body of Olima in her arm while sitting on the road next to the psychiatric clinic. There was a bullet stuck in Olima’s head.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="424" data-line-end="425">Police officers surrounded the area and started their investigation. They asked Venta all about the murder. “What happened?” asked one of the police officers.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="426" data-line-end="427">“It is KARAM who did this. The bullet came from that way” Venta pointed towards the under construction building.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="428" data-line-end="429">After some time, one of the police officers said, “We are going inside the under construction hotel.” They went up to the fourth floor and there the police found a bullet shell. It was a 7.62×51mm bullet shell.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="430" data-line-end="432">For fake KARAM, taking her life is fun, but for Venta it is a sad moment, she lost her sister and her best friend.<br>
        Olima was dead, her body was taken to the mortuary. The police requested the family for the postmortem, but the family straight away disagreed. Venta on the other hand keeps on insisting the family agree for at least the ballistic report. Olima’s.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="433" data-line-end="434">The very next day was the funeral of Olima Gerald. Her friends, family and lots of her youtube fans came to her funeral. Olima being an internet celebrity got a lot of coverage from the media.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="435" data-line-end="436">All of her friends and their guards were interviewed by the media. There is one thing common in all the interviews, everyone said, “KARAM did this all. He killed her”. The real KARAM secretly attended the funeral as Adam. He also gave the interview, and he said that “KARAM did this”, only he knew which KARAM he was talking about.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="437" data-line-end="438">Till this day the girls didn’t know that all this time Adam was helping them find KARAM, simply means that he was helping them find himself, or we can say that all this time he was diverting them to find himself.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="439" data-line-end="440">Standing next to the coffin Venta was thinking of the incident last evening, she can still see and feel the blood stains on her hands. “Why?.. why I failed to save her… Why did we go there?” Venta started feeling like a loser. Now the other girl’s families thought that having guards was useless. They can’t protect the girls.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="441" data-line-end="442">There is no other move that the family can take, so they decided to move out of the city. They thought that this place was no longer safe from them. First it took Karia’s life, and now Olima’s.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="443" data-line-end="444">KARAM had become the pro level criminal of Boston, Massachusetts. KARAM did not want this to happen, he did not know how to stop this. He, at this moment, can’t think of anything to do. The only thing he thought of was to protect the girls by himself.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="445" data-line-end="446">There would be two things.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="447" data-line-end="448">If the family stays then the fake KARAM’s evil acts will still go on, still creating chaos.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="449" data-line-end="451">If the family goes out of the city, they won’t be safe because he knows that if he can go out of Boston to make the girls wear the rings, the fake KARAM can do it too.<br>
        Adam contacted Maedrian to be at her apartment. He contacted all the girls from the private number, “I am someone who can tell you the truth about KARAM, and I can help you get rid of the rings on your finger. Follow the link, get to the location as soon as possible”. He knew that everyone wants to get rid of the rings, so they will definitely come to his apartment. He wants to help them.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="452" data-line-end="453">A few moments later, they all meet up at Adam’s apartment. “You said that you can tell us who is KARAM?” Everyone asked. “Let’s say, for a moment, that I am KARAM…” Adam said, walking back and forth.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="454" data-line-end="455">“You can’t be KARAM. You are so nice” Mary said.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="456" data-line-end="457">“Me! being nice makes you think that I can’t be KARAM?” Adam questioned.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="458" data-line-end="459">“When he talks face to face with us he always says Hello little ladies” Edon said.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="460" data-line-end="461">KARAM did everything they say the actual KARAM did to make them believe that he is KARAM. “Believe me guys. I am the actual KARAM, and I did not kill Olima or Karia. There is someone pretending to be me, and that fake me was doing all this”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="462" data-line-end="463">“Why do we believe you?” Josephine said.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="464" data-line-end="465">“If I need to hurt you guys. Why would I tell you everything? Believe me, you are safe with me” KARAM replied.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="466" data-line-end="467">“Wait… If KARAM. I mean Keith didn’t kill Olima, so who?” Edon stood up, pacing back and forth, “…Keith had a motive because he is Saphira’s husband… so if someone else is doing this shit, he must be related to Saphira for sure…”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="468" data-line-end="469">“Why He? That person could be she” Maedrian said, sitting at the edge of the room with her laptop, trying to stop the rings from working.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="470" data-line-end="471">“…Because girls are not that evil,” Edon replied. Keith gave her a serious look.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="472" data-line-end="473">“Yes…” Maedrian shouted.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="474" data-line-end="475">“What happened?” Everyone asked.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="476" data-line-end="477">“The rings would not work anymore… But” Maedrian paused, biting her nails.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="478" data-line-end="479">“But…What? Tell us please” All the girls asked.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="480" data-line-end="482">“…It would be painful to take those rings off. And if you keep them on it might start working again”.<br>
        “I don’t care for the pain. I am just gonna cut it off” Josephine said.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="483" data-line-end="484">“Are you gonna cut your finger off?” Pamela asked, with a serious look on her face.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="485" data-line-end="486">“Are you stupid. Why would I cut my finger” Josephine replied.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="487" data-line-end="488">“Okay… do you have anything to cut these rings” Pamela said to Keith</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="489" data-line-end="490">“I’ll help you guys take those off, but please don’t scream” Maedrian said, squinting.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="491" data-line-end="493">As soon as all the rings were off, with few screams, there was a knock at the door. “Boston police… Open up”.<br>
        On the day of Olima’s funeral, the whole area was covered with the news reporters. Everyone thought it was for Olima, but no. The news reporters came to her funeral to get the news about KARAM, they don’t care if anyone is dead or not.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="494" data-line-end="495">All the girls said the same thing that KARAM killed her, even though they were not there at that moment, and didn’t see him shooting but they all were so confident about their statement.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="496" data-line-end="497">Adam took a risk that day. He gave an interview to the reporter, “It is obvious that know one saw KARAM killing Olima, but who else would do that. No one else other than KARAM has a motive to kill the girl…or, does anyone else have the motive? Now it is up to the police to find out who was actually behind this murder. Thank you so much”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="498" data-line-end="499">From the Boston police department. Officer Hector is watching the live news and on the tv he sees Adam. Hector ran towards the cyber department and ordered them to make the public know that Adam is not what they thought.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="500" data-line-end="501">“Make that face go viral on the news. We need to find Adam. He is the criminal” Hector shouted.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="502" data-line-end="503">There was a prize money of $100,000, whoever finds or helps the police to find Adam Walter. The only reason that was mentioned on the news for finding Adam was that he is the most wanted criminal. The police didn’t say that he is KARAM, or he is supposed to be KARAM because they weren’t sure.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="504" data-line-end="505">Keith didn’t know that he went viral on the news. He was doing his work without being aware that everyone was on the bounty hunt for him. He and Maedrian didn’t know anything because they were too busy in finding the solution for saving the girls.</p>
        <hr>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="508" data-line-end="509">Next day evening, an unknown number gave a tip to the police that he saw Adam. The unknown number didn’t tell his name at that moment for privacy concerns, he gave the location of the building where he saw Adam going. The unknown caller followed Adam to his apartment.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="510" data-line-end="511">What else could happen? There was a knock at the door, “Boston police, open up”. The police entered the apartment and handcuffed both Keith and Maedrian.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="512" data-line-end="514">“They didn’t do anything. They helped us. The real criminal is somewhere else” Girls shouted. All of them said that they are innocent but the police didn’t listen to a single word.<br>
        Boston police handcuffed and put Keith and Maedrian into the police car. They both were taken to the police station like they both were man reading monsters. Keith was thrown to the chair in the interrogation room with Lisa and Hector. Maedrian was taken somewhere else.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="515" data-line-end="516">“Hey, Adam, or should I call you KARAM” Lisa said. Keith was in shock seeing both of them, he didn’t say a word.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="517" data-line-end="518">Surprise, surprise. You must have been wondering how we caught you… It would be a mystery for you, because you like mysteries, right?</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="519" data-line-end="520">“Surprise, surprise. You must have been wondering how we caught you… It would be a mystery for you, because you like mysteries, right?” Lisa slapped him on the face. “Your other buddies will be captured soon… For now we have you and that bitch of yours…”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="521" data-line-end="522">“You want me… You got me. Leave her alone. She didn’t do anything” Keith said in a serious tone.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="523" data-line-end="524">“Somebody got killed a few days back. You and everyone related to you are involved in this” Officer Hector said, moving close to him.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="525" data-line-end="526">Lisa tried to say something but paused, giving Keith a look.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="527" data-line-end="528">“Even if she’s not the bad guy… She is involved with you, and she is a criminal too. Just like you” Hector said, sitting on the next chair to him.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="529" data-line-end="530">“She, and even I am not involved in any sort of murder. I know I did some bad stuff, but I am not a killer” Karam said, staring at Hector.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="531" data-line-end="532">“Somebody’s gotta get charged for that murder.” Lisa said, curled lips.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="533" data-line-end="534">“So… You can charge me with anything you want. I used that girl as my pawn, she didn’t do anything wrong.” KARAM said with an innocent face.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="535" data-line-end="536">“We’re gonna prove that you both are involved in the murder of Karia William and Olima Gerald” Hector said.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="537" data-line-end="538">“You give us the names of your other buddies, and we might think of losing her free…” Lisa was about to complete the sentence but soon she saw gas entering the room. All three fainted right away.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="539" data-line-end="540">Someone attacked the police department with the smoke bombs. The whole department was covered in smoke, and everyone was down. A girl dressed like KARAM entered the smoke with a gas mask on. She tied and dragged Keith and Maedrian outside and threw them in the van.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="541" data-line-end="542">Keith and Maedrian were rolling at the back of the van. As soon as the engine of the van roared, there was a black jeep at the corner of the police department, like someone was trying to follow them.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="543" data-line-end="544">The van took them to an rusty old abandoned warehouse in Boston. In the middle of the police department and warehouse, Keith and Maedrian woke up, still rolling at the back of the van.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="545" data-line-end="546">There was a room in the corner of the warehouse. Fake KARAM took them both out of the van and took them to the room at gunpoint. She tied them both to the chair, and took a deep breath. She took off her mask. Keith recognized her but couldn’t say a word.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="547" data-line-end="548">“Martha. You?” Keth said, stammering. He recognized that the fake KARAM was Martha, Saphira’s younger sister.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="549" data-line-end="550">“I know what you’re gonna say. Calm down bro, I will tell you everything” Martha replied. She moved towards the other chair, where Maedrian was tied.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="551" data-line-end="552">“Hey. You… Bitch. I know what you did with those rings, and now you’re gonna make those shock rings again, much stronger than before”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="553" data-line-end="554">“You think I am stupid? I don’t want to make anyone’s life a hell again. I will never make those rings again… and if I or anyone else makes those rings, I will make sure that those girls won’t put them on.” Maedrian disagreed right away.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="555" data-line-end="556">“Oh! really?” Martha slapped her so hard that she fell down on the floor, still tied to the chair.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="557" data-line-end="559">“Can you please stop this, and tell me why you are doing this. Why do you want to kill them? I’ve already done so much with them. Please stop this” Keith said, looking into her eyes.<br>
        “Listen. You are playing with these girls because of Saphira, obviously. I have the same reason. It is tit for tat. They killed my sister, and now I am going to kill them all” Martha said, moving closer to him.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="560" data-line-end="561">“I’ve already taught them the lesson. That’s enough. Please don’t kill other girls” Keith said.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="562" data-line-end="563">“When I saw the news that Karia died. People were saying that KARAM killed her. I got the idea of becoming KARAM. I know you Keith Andrew. It wasn’t hard for me to guess that KARAM is your initials”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="564" data-line-end="565">“How did you get into my laptop?” Maedrian said, still on the floor, trying to get up. Martha gets close to her and helps get her up.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="566" data-line-end="567">“Oh! That. I saw the video of Karia, and I know about the rings system. I’ve hired a hacker to hack Keith, and from there I found you. I stalked you for a month then I told the hacker to clone your laptop in the same looking laptop as yours… One day when you were going on a trip, I entered your apartment and replaced your laptop with a fake one… You guys played with others, and I played with you”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="568" data-line-end="570">Boom. Someone entered the warehouse. “How? Nobody knows this play. How can someone come here?” Martha pointed the gun towards the door.<br>
        Sitting in a black jeep outside the Boston police department, she was waiting for KARAM. She had seen in the news that Adam is KARAM, and since then she had been waiting for him in the jeep, outside the police department, to see if she could find a chance to shoot him.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="571" data-line-end="572">After a while, everything that happened there was beyond her imagination.  A girl dressed like KARAM entered the smoke with a gas mask on. “What the hell is happening” Venta got confused.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="573" data-line-end="574">Around ten to fifteen minutes later the female version of KARAM dragged Adam and a girl (who is unknown to Venta) and threw them into the van. Venta had seen the whole smoke bomb attack on police departmen.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="575" data-line-end="576">The only thing on his mind was the misunderstanding in the hearts of the girl’s families that they could not save their daughters. She should get rid of this misunderstanding. The other thing was that she wanted to avenge Olima’s death from Salman, she had sworn.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="577" data-line-end="578">She does not have any other option instead of following the van. From about seven to eight feets away from the van, she followed until it stopped at the old abandoned warehouse. Venta waited outside for a long time. She needs to make a plan before she enters the warehouse.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="579" data-line-end="580">Around forty five minutes of waiting, Venta entered the warehouse where she saw a room at the corner. Boom, she started firing bullets at the door.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="581" data-line-end="582">The door opens by itself and Venta sees Adam and Maedrian tied on the chair. Without any second thought she shot Adam, It was a headshot, like fake KARAM did with Olima. Venta then shot Martha in the leg.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="583" data-line-end="584">“I am sending you the location. Someone killed KARAM” Venta texted the police department, threw her phone on the ground, and walked outside. She felt relieved.</p>
        <hr>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="587" data-line-end="589">Police arrived at the location. They saw Martha on the floor, bleeding leg, motionless and Maedrian crying. Keith’s body was taken for the postmortem, and Martha and Maedrian was charged with the murder of Keith Andrew.<br>
        There was news all over Boston that the real KARAM is Keith Andrew Ravera Antonio Martine, and he is dead now. KARAM or Keith or Adam died without being proved innocent, everyone still thinks he is the killer of Karia and Olima.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="590" data-line-end="591">Everything seems to be over now. All the families packed up their luggage and started to drive far away from Boston, where there is no evil. Soon they reached the Zero KM Boston sign. Boom. Every single car exploded.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="592" data-line-end="593">Martha had already attached the boom with the cars before she captured Maedian and Keith.</p>
        <hr>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="596" data-line-end="598">Martha heard the news from inside the cell, she laughed. She had executed the plan that she wanted to.<br>
        A week has passed after the mystery letter incident. Everything seemed quite normal until the girls came back from the school. It was like that the warning on the letter was in action now and they have no idea what to do.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="599" data-line-end="600">To Mary everything supposed to be okay, for her the warning was just an empty threat but when she came home from school she saw everything upside down in her apartment and her mom was sitting on the floor, head in hands.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="601" data-line-end="602">“What happened mom?.. Why is everything upside down” Mary asked, staring towards the upside down furniture and her broken cameras and laptop on the floor.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="603" data-line-end="604">“Some masked guys broke into our house with a baseball bat.They asked me where the devices were… and they started breaking things in every room…” Mary’s mom said, taking pauses after every sentence. “Why didn’t you call the police?” Marry asked, she was out of her senses. “I did. They are on their way”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="605" data-line-end="606">Mary walked outside the apartment without saying a word. She called Olima, Edon, Pamella and Libby to meet her at the park. It was around 3:52PM in the evening when the girls met in the park.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="607" data-line-end="608">“You said, Just relax, everything will be fine, and what fine is that… He destroyed our laptops and cameras” Olima said, pointing towards Mary. Everyone went silent.  “I went to the police that day… They think it’s a prank. I am going to the police again” Olima continued after a pause.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="609" data-line-end="610">“Mom called the police. They will soon find who is behind all this” Mary said in a low voice. “I’ve called the police too. They will be home soon” Pamela said.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="611" data-line-end="612">Ding, ding, ding, ding all the phones beep at the same time. They all got a message from KARAM. “Who is this KARAM, and why is there no number?” Libby asked, and she was confused to see that there is no phone number for KARAM.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="613" data-line-end="614">Hello Hello little ladies…</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="615" data-line-end="617">Sorry for the destruction of your precious belongings. Now you have to behave well, or else the destruction would be big next time.<br>
        There would be a black Lexus soon where you were, and your job is to get inside the car, nothing wrong going to happen with you, if you obey and if you don’t, you have seen what can happen.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="618" data-line-end="620">Love<br>
        KARAM</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="621" data-line-end="622">The message deleted itself a minute after it was sent. A car reached the park exactly after ten minutes of the message and the back door opened automatically. Libby went inside the car first, Olima after her. Mary and Pamela looked at each other standing a few meters away from the car.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="623" data-line-end="624">They were confused and hesitated to get inside the car. “Get inside. You guys don’t have any other choice. Just shut the fuck up, and get inside” Olima shouted.</p>
        <hr>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="627" data-line-end="628">There is something weird with this car that clicked Olima’s mind but she’s not in the state of giving too much attention to this weirdness. The car drove on Tremont Street, heading towards a place that is known to them but still unknown. The car entered the dark empty parking lot of a newly constructed shopping mall.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="629" data-line-end="630">A man and a lady in a black hoodie, from the front side of the car, came out and dragged the girls out, tied their hands and covered their eyes. The girls were pushed forward towards another car, bigger than the previous one.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="631" data-line-end="632">The car took a stop at a place where the girls were taken out of the car. The lady united their hands and uncovered their eyes. They were standing in front of an abandoned research lab. Later they were in a half lit room. They were tied to the chairs in front of an 80 inches tv screen.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="633" data-line-end="634">The video started playing on the screen. There was a young man in a black jacket with the hood on. He started introducing himself.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="635" data-line-end="637">Hello Hello little ladies. I hope you all were here.<br>
        I am KARAM. You don’t know me but I know you all very very much, even more than you know yourselves. Other girls are already being warned but you guys are acting too smart. You guys have no other choice other than obeying my orders, or else</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="638" data-line-end="639">After this short message the girls were dropped back at the same park they were picked up from but this time the man and the lady stepped out of the car. The man threw the keys towards Olima and they walked towards the other side of the road where there was a car waiting for them.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="640" data-line-end="641">“It’s my car. How…” Olima whispered to herself, “KARAM is so smart” she was shocked seeing her car.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="642" data-line-end="643">Exposing KARAM</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="644" data-line-end="645">Karia got traumatized after seeing KARAM back in town. She thought he would again open the topic of her diary, or do something weird. She was afraid, too much scared of being tortured again by him.  She with a heavy heart sat down in front of the camera and started a video to describe the things happening with her.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="646" data-line-end="647">“Hey guys this is your girl Karia”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="648" data-line-end="651">Today’s video is going to be a little different from usual. As you guys know that I and my group haven’t  uploaded any videos for the past one and a half years…<br>
        I am going to tell you guys the truth about why we are not posting videos. This topic is too serious guys….<br>
        And  this will be my last video on this channel.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="652" data-line-end="654">There was a guy called KARMA. He harassed us all, and this ring is the proof of that. We all have this, it gives shock when we disobey him…<br>
        And believe me guys I have been so scared to make this video because I don’t know what He is gonna do to me after this video.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="655" data-line-end="656">It all happened to me around August, 2017, On a trip to Orlando, Florida… The only people who knew that this happened were I, my parents and my friends. This wasn’t my first encounter with KARAM.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="657" data-line-end="664">I first encountered KARAM when I was on my shoot for Threads fashion company, near Tadpole playground, in front of Boston Common Carousel.<br>
        When I first saw him, I thought it was a hallucination…<br>
        Olima told me about him but I did not believe her. He did not do anything. Just said, “Hey, Hey, Hey bitch…”.<br>
        (He always says this HEY,HEY thing, whenever He talks to us, live face to face).<br>
        He was too close to my face but I couldn’t see his face.<br>
        He is always in a black hoodie and a mask. “I will come for you”, He said in a serious tone and pressed my wrist so hard…<br>
        KARAM didn’t allow us to tell anything to anyone, not even our family.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="665" data-line-end="670">We girls went to the police but they have nothing to do with this matter…<br>
        The lawyer that we hired and the federal system kind of gave up on this. To us and our family the lawyer and the police said that it was all a misunderstanding.<br>
        I am not going to name these people…<br>
        And what can they do? There is no record of this KARAM.<br>
        As I told you guys he is always in black hoodie and a mask, no one in this country has seen his face. He is a mystery to all of us.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="671" data-line-end="676">Back in Orlando.<br>
        It was our group’s second meet and greet at .<br>
        I actually was not there on the first meet and greet when the scene happened…<br>
        My bff Matilda told me a scene that happened there. When She, Pamela and her sister June went to the mall for shopping, they were attacked by KARAM.<br>
        No one has any clue about how He went there and how He knew each and every step of ours.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="677" data-line-end="683">It is really hard to talk about because it happened last year and it triggers something…<br>
        It’s really bad every time I remember it. It is a… very traumatic experience.<br>
        If I somehow knew about that scene going to happen, I would never be there.<br>
        In a skype group chat few of the members mentioned that someone is recording the chat.<br>
        My account, and everyone else’s accounts were not working properly. We are being hacked by someone.<br>
        KARAM is always a step ahead of us. He can track us but we can’t.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="684" data-line-end="694">Now we’re going to move on our trip with my team towards the glass penthouse, where all this ring stuff happened.<br>
        At night during the sleepover, when we girls were doing our stuff.<br>
        I heard a knock at the door…<br>
        I opened the door, but there was no one…<br>
        A moment later, in a blink of an eye, KARAM grabbed me from behind and put a knife to my throat, I was scared to death.<br>
        He threw something on the counter. I couldn’t see, and shouted in a deep voice…<br>
        ”Put those rings on, or She’ll die”.<br>
        Olima said, stepping forward to pick up the bag “Don’t hurt her. We will do as you say”.<br>
        KARAM forcibly put the ring on my finger, and believe me it hurts… so much that I’ve fainted.<br>
        When I opened my eyes, Olima and Matilda were lying on the bed, and everyone else was standing right in front of us.</p>
        <hr>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="696" data-line-end="697">Two days later…</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="698" data-line-end="705">Karia got a text from Matilda.<br>
        Are you serious Karia!!! Why did you post the video? You know what’s gonna happen to all of us……<br>
        And listen…how did you take off the ring?.<br>
        When She saw the message, “The ring was off. How’s that possible” She was confused, looking at her ring.<br>
        She opened her laptop and played the video. There was actually no ring in the video, just a blob of light which looks like a camera flash.<br>
        It’s a shiny metallic ring that shines and reflects the light around it.<br>
        Karia started sobbing. She scrolled down in the comment section and saw many comments;</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="706" data-line-end="717">Chunky_112: Where’s the ring?<br>
        StaceyTee: What ring are you talking about? There is no ring on your finger.<br>
        Miss_Martha:R u really serious. Do u know what u r saying!!!<br>
        Willy007: If KARAM is real. He is quite cool.<br>
        Mark.11: #KARAMFORLIFE<br>
        Helda00: You are a bloody attention seeker.<br>
        Casanova_1: HEY,HEY<br>
        op_ruh: hey,hey,hey it’s KARAM.<br>
        .<br>
        .<br>
        .</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="718" data-line-end="719">Zammy: Hi I am KARAM. hahahaha.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="720" data-line-end="724">Being worried and scared to death. Karia deleted the video but it was too late, the video has gone viral and so many people shared the video on their ids. She thought that this video was going to end the KARAM chapter but the opposite happened.<br>
        Everyone started liking this KARMA person, everyone is changing their dp’s to anonymous hoodie people.<br>
        Before the video there was only one KARAM, but now there will be so many.<br>
        April 2016</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="725" data-line-end="726">The tour bus was currently in Downtown Disney where the meet and greet would be held. There were posters of their meet and greet all around Disneyland. All the girls were hooting, singing and doing weird stuff.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="727" data-line-end="728">The music around the area was so loud and everyone was lost in their own zone. KARAM can do anything unnoticed. Soon as they walked outside the bus all of the girls went their own ways. Pamela and June decided to go shopping on their own, without telling anyone.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="729" data-line-end="730">Pamela and June went inside an electronics shop. Pamela picked up a headphone, Ruby ran towards a corner of the store and picked up a panda MP3 player wearing a mini bow. “I got this one” June said to Pamela, asking her to buy that for her. “Okay, but no more expensive stuff.” Pamela smiled. As they were getting out of the makeup store, KARAM somehow found a way to snatch her arm and drag her towards the corner of the mall where he tried to give her the ring box. His plan was that he would threaten her and force her to wear the ring and make others wear it too. Pamela was lucky because as they were in the corner, the guard came shouting “What are you guys doing there”, and KARAM ran away.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="731" data-line-end="732">They walked to the hotel room, ignoring everything that happened. Later that day a really bad thing happened to both June and Pamela. After their so called fun time, as they entered the room they saw KARAM sitting on the couch, waiting for them. KARAM somehow manages to enter her room, he had a universal key thingy.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="733" data-line-end="734">June covered herself with random stuff for her safety from the guy, unknown to her. She saw KARAM for the first time and thought he was a thief or something.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="735" data-line-end="736">“Sit down ladies” KARAM ordered them…“I have something special for you Pam”. “What?” Pamela asked, in fear. June stared at them in confusion, standing in the corner of the room. “You have to put this on, and make your friends wear it too” KARAM grabbed Pamela’s arm and showed her the metal box with some shiny rings.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="737" data-line-end="738">The doorbell rang, it was room service. June was standing still as a statue. KARAM left Pamela’s arm, and gestured to her to open the door. “Hey you little one… Go somewhere else, don’t be weird” KARAM said to June, and walked away towards the window.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="739" data-line-end="740">At night they all went to the cinema at their own expense. KARAM was sitting on the third row behind them, staring at them. He wanted to find the right moment to get them at one place and forced them to wear the rings. The day was not on KARMAs side, something bad happened again. One girl is missing, Karia William.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="741" data-line-end="742">Now there are two options for him, either he drops the plan or uses the rings he had and forget about Karia… KARAM left the cinema hall and called Maedrian, “Karia is missing. I am dropping the plan. We have to find another way to make them wear the rings” KARAM whispered on the phone, like he was sending a secret voicemail.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="743" data-line-end="744">—-------</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="745" data-line-end="746">On the very next day KARAM went back to boston. He kicked the couch, throwing stuff all around his living room, he was furious about his failed plan. “We need to talk sir,” Maedrian texted. “Come to the apartment. We can talk here” KARAM replied.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="747" data-line-end="748">About half an hour later, KARAM and Maedrian were sitting in the living room. Maedrian was showing him that there are seven rings and nine girls. She showed him the list of the girls;</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="749" data-line-end="750">First one is Olima Gerald, Second is Mary Raymond, Third is Edon Mathew, Fourth is Josephine Edler, Fifth is Pamela Smith, Sixth is Matilda Harris, Seventh is Karia Williams, Eighth is Libby Butler and the last ninth one is June Smith, Pamela’s little sister. “These girls have such weird names” Maedrian stared at the names with a straight face.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="751" data-line-end="753">“Take the last two names out. Libby and June are not involved” KARAM ordered.<br>
        It’s Tuesday, 2012, Morning</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="754" data-line-end="755">It is a new bright morning for Libby. She was about to work on a video for her youTube channel. After taking shower she went to her desk and opened her book of ideas. Every idea has been crossed already. Dropping her notebook on the desk, she went outside to do her daily makeup, and at that point an idea clicked her mind.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="756" data-line-end="757">“I should make a Morning makeup routine video” Libby thought, there was an imaginary light bulb over her head. Inside the living room she set up the camera to stand in front of the table and sat on the carpet with all her makeup products on the table.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="758" data-line-end="759">After five minutes her mom came toward her with an envelope in her hand when she was too busy shooting her makeup video. “Darling… Someone sent you this letter” Mom said, staring towards the envelope, and whispered to herself, “Who sends letters these days?” Libby saw her mom getting confused as she was staring at an envelope in her hand.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="760" data-line-end="761">After a pause mom said “Whatever… and listen. I am going to my work and I will be back at 6PM hopefully. Take care of yourself and if you need anything, give me a call. Bye. Love you”. “Love you too mom” Libby replied with a smile, and walked behind her to close the door.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="762" data-line-end="763">Libby did not bother a bit to open the envelope. She threw it on the table and continued to shoot her video.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="764" data-line-end="765">Around 3PM when she was watching the TV she remembered that she was forgetting something. Again nothing came to her mind then she started to walk towards her room, and on her way back to her room  she saw the envelope that she left on the table in the living room.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="766" data-line-end="767">As she opened the envelope with curiosity. There was a warning message on the front page in the basic Times new Roman font. There was a message on the backside, “Stop making videos or you will regret”. After a few seconds the ink removed itself and there was only the black sheet of paper left behind.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="768" data-line-end="769">This stuff looks sketchy to her, but Libby got a call from her sister, ”let’s go to the mall”. “Okay I am ready. Let’s go” Libby replied with a smile, and dropped the letter on the table, she forgot about anything that happened.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="770" data-line-end="772">In the evening, Libby and her elder sister Stella were in the mall. When they were about to walk inside the Primark store, Libby got a message from Olima, “Hey!… Can we meet?? In front of Bacon Hill Cleaners. I would be in my car”. Libby wanted to call her, but instead she messaged her, “I would be there in half an hour. I am in the mall with my sister now”.<br>
        Monday Morning.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="773" data-line-end="774">KARAM is sitting on his couch, sipping his usual coffee, still thinking about what Karia did to herself. Soon he opened his laptop and scrolled down to find recent Boston news. On scrolling down he saw a video titled “He is back”. Olima uploaded it tomorrow. He did not want to open the video because now he was trying to end this KARAM game.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="775" data-line-end="776">He couldn’t resist so he clicked the video.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="777" data-line-end="778">“Hello guys! I don’t really know how to start this video, or what to say… This would be my first last video. Okay… I am gonna start with KARAM.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="779" data-line-end="780">Not what he did with us, or the ring stuff. I am here to talk about what the news said, and what everyone thinks… In the news Kevin Anderson died and they said he is KARAM… The evil has ended… But.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="781" data-line-end="782">Tomorrow When I woke up I saw a message on my phone… the same as KARAM used to send us when he wanted to give us some sort of task to complete…It said THE GAME IS NOT OVER YET, and after that my ring gave me an electric shock.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="783" data-line-end="785">If he is dead… What news people say… So… Who is still operating these rings?<br>
        Believe me guys Kevin Anderson was not the actual KARAM. He is still out there somewhere and we still don’t know who he is.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="786" data-line-end="787">Through this video. I ask the government to give us protection or somehow find the actual KARMA.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="788" data-line-end="789">Thank you Guys to sticking around with me.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="790" data-line-end="791">Bye”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="792" data-line-end="793">“What the heck. Why are the rings still working?” He talked to himself. “This must be a lie. This must be some sort of a publicity stunt”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="794" data-line-end="795">He started walking back and forth in his apartment. He walks in his room and picks his phone from the bed, and dialed Maedrian’s phone number. “The rings are still working? And who the hell is giving them commands. If this is true? This situation is going to create danger for me”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="796" data-line-end="797">“I don’t know sir. I think someone hacked the software of the rings. I am on vacation with my family right now. I will recover the software as soon as possible. You just relax, no worries” Maedrian said, cutting the conversation.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="798" data-line-end="799">Karam sat on his couch, still thinking about the video.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="800" data-line-end="801">“Maybe it is a hoax. Maybe it is a plan to fool me. But if it is not, then what will I do? I need to get to the bottom of this, and figure out what she was up to?&quot;. After two hours of thinking, Karam finally decided to go outside for a walk and take some fresh air. He was not able to take any more pressure.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="802" data-line-end="803">As he was walking through the streets, he saw a group of people standing in front of a small building. He could see a couple of policemen standing next to the building. He put his face down and walked silently towards the other side.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="804" data-line-end="812">Sipping his black coffee, Keith settled down on his most comfy couch. It’s Tuesday morning.<br>
        Keith turned on the TV to find out what’s going on in Boston. He clicked through different news channels, and they all have the same news.<br>
        Good Morning. My name is Lisa Francis and you are watching channel 25. Today is April 9th, 2019, Tuesday. We have so much interesting information for our viewers but,<br>
        We begin our day by unfolding the mystery of KARAM or now we can say Kevin Anderson.<br>
        KARAM was the most wanted vandal of the United States of America. It’s said that Kevin Anderson uses RAM in his name because he was an Aries zodiac. He is also involved in some sort of cult-related activities. By profession he was an engineer and a hacker<br>
        Kevin was shot dead at 6:00PM USA (GMT-4), April 8th, 2019, Monday near Boston, Parkman Bandstand.<br>
        From all the available information it’s said that he got shot at the back of his head during his escape from Boston police officer Hector Ross……<br>
        Keith put on his jacket, turned off the TV, finished his coffee and walked outside the apartment…</p>
        <hr>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="813" data-line-end="824">On April 8, 2019, Monday. The rain was about to start and the clouds were getting darker and darker. Today KARAM was at the wrong place at the wrong time.<br>
        It was 6:00pm in the evening. The girls and Adam were sitting near the Earl of Sandwich. They were discussing the security measures they should take to be safe from the attack. It’s not an easy job to do because they had tried so many tactics, but KARAM is always one step ahead of them.<br>
        There were many passers by in the premises. One of them was in a black jacket with the hood on, spying on them from outside the tennis court. They all knew that there might be someone, somewhere around, spying on them, but they don’t know he would be that close.<br>
        It would be harder for the man in the black jacket to attack them because of Adam being with them. First he had to distract him. Exactly five minutes later Adam walked a few meters away from the girls, but it was not the plan of black jacket man. Whatever, He didn’t care, this moment was a gold coin for him.<br>
        The man walks slowly towards Edon. He tries to chloroform her. He failed because luck is not always on one person’s side, this time there was a sound heard by both of them, “Don’t move. You are under arrest” officer Hector shouts, with his gun pointed towards the black jacket man. That man was supposed to be Adam who called the police but nothing was clear now.<br>
        The man in the back jacket ran towards the Parkman, Bandstand. It’s easier for him to hide somewhere in the dark. The rain had started, and it was making the ground look like a lake, which was creating difficulty for him to run.<br>
        As he reached closer to the bandstand, officer Hector shouted,”Stop it, or I’ll shoot”. Rain is also creating difficulty for him to listen to the clear sound of what the officer Hector was saying.<br>
        Officer had shot the bullet, and it hit the black jacket man in the middle of the skull from the back. He fell down on his face, motionless, and the blood is getting washed away in the rain. Officer Hector called the police jeep to take away the body.<br>
        The group of girls standing a few meters away from the dead body, holding hands and standing close to each other. Edon was getting curious and she went closer to the body. “Your game is over” She whispered. She tried to check his identity, but officer Hector said ”don’t touch the body”. “I just want to see his face and ID card,” Edon asked Politely.<br>
        Officer turned the body over and took out his wallet to show the ID to the girl, “Kevin Anderson” Edon read aloud his name. Everyone of them came close to the body to see the face of evil, which haunted them for years.<br>
        6:15AM.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="825" data-line-end="826">“I never thought you would do this to yourself” KARAM talking to himself, standing at the place where Karia fell down given her life. The blood stains were still there. A plan for the taste of their own medicine went too far.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="827" data-line-end="828">He never wanted anyone to take their own life, he just wanted to teach them a little lesson about how it feels when you bring someone to a situation that you left them with no chance, but to take their own life.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="829" data-line-end="830">Little did he know that teaching them the lesson would become a nightmare for him.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="831" data-line-end="832">KARAM heard a voice from behind, someone was walking slowly towards him. When he looked back it was Maedrian. “What are you doing here sir?” She asked.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="833" data-line-end="834">“I don’t have any other choice but to be here. I can’t let her go like this. It’s my fault she took her life away, and if I keep this same thing happening, others gonna do the same thing” KARAM replied, looking at the blood stains, lost in his thoughts.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="835" data-line-end="836">“Please don’t blame yourself for what happened to her, you had no idea she was going to do this, and it wasn’t your fault. Please sir, leave this place, we need to get out of this area before anyone sees us, and connect us with this suicide&quot; Maedrian replied, putting a hand on his shoulder.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="837" data-line-end="838">Soon they both reached the apartment. Maedrian walked towards the kitchen, “I will make you some breakfast” She said, giving him a smile.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="839" data-line-end="840">“Hey Maddie… Shutdown those rings. I want to free these girls” KARMA shouts from the living room.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="841" data-line-end="843">“I will do it sir. I don’t have my laptop now…” Maedrian said, bringing toast and egg for him, “I might go now, it’s getting late” Maedrian said, looking at the wall clock. As she left the apartment she looked at him from behind, “Sorry sir” She whispered to herself.<br>
        After uploading the video, He is Back… Olima went outside her room for breakfast. As soon as she had her breakfast, she went to her room, picked up the phone and messaged the girls to meet up at the cafe to talk.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="844" data-line-end="845">“Meet me at Ziggy’s Cafe… Now. We need to talk” Olima typed the message in a group chat. All six of them replied okay, but in their own style.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="846" data-line-end="847">She walked into the cafe and was greeted by the girls.  They sat at a table as Olima sat down at the end of the table.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="848" data-line-end="849">The girls immediately began to discuss the video Olima posted this morning. “We watched the video and we were really impressed by your guts, you are not looking even a little bit scared of him” Mary, Edon and Pamela said.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="850" data-line-end="851">“Who do you think controls the rings? KARAM… I mean Kevin is dead now, right?” Matilda said, biting her lower lip.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="852" data-line-end="853">“That’s what I am about to say. Listen carefully” Olima said.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="854" data-line-end="855">“Yes…Yes…Yes…” Everyone said in unison.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="856" data-line-end="857">“The question is that…is KARAM dead or alive. Because, if KARMA… aka Kevin Anderson died then who the hell is controlling the rings” Olima took a sip of juice.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="858" data-line-end="859">“The rings could be on automatic setting??” Josephine said, confused.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="860" data-line-end="861">Olima continued, “It can be the possibility. What I think is that he is still alive, somewhere around us in Boston, and Kevin must be one of his pawns… or”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="862" data-line-end="863">“…Or one of his pawns are controlling the rings” Josiephine complete Olima’s sentence.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="864" data-line-end="865">“Yup… This can be the possibility too. But still the question is the same. Is KARAM dead or alive” Olima is confused.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="866" data-line-end="867">“If he is still alive, he is gonna ruin our lives…Again” Edon said, in a cocky manner.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="868" data-line-end="869">“Who knows?” Everyone said in unison.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="870" data-line-end="871">Whatever is happening to them is done by whom? Someone thinks it’s KARAM, and someone thinks it is someone related to KARAM.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="872" data-line-end="874">At the same moment when they were discussing KARAM being dead or alive, they all got a task, “DON’T WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS. YOU ONLY HAVE TO FOLLOW MY ORDERS”. They all got electric shocks right after this message.<br>
        Second Meet and Greet</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="875" data-line-end="876">They all reached Orlando around 5:00 PM sharp. The bus was already waiting for them outside the airport. The bus was quite similar to the bus which picked them on first meet and greet.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="877" data-line-end="878">The bus goes around the major areas, and gives them all a small tour of the city. They all got refreshments. The bus did not stop, it moved continuously around the city. Around 6:10 PM the bus took them to a beautiful penthouse. It was a luxurious penthouse booked for them by Mr.Keith. The whole penthouse was empty, there were only these seven girls in the penthouse. Everything was available for them inside this place.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="879" data-line-end="880">Around 9:30 PM when all the girls were busy making something weird in the kitchen, there was a knock at the door, “You guys do your work. I’ll go check the door” Karia said, chewing on a carrot. As the door opened, a man in the black jacked with the hood and mask on, grabbed Karias hand and put a blade on her throat. “KARAM…” everyone shouted.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="881" data-line-end="882">He dragged Karia towards the kitchen and put a metal box on the kitchen counter and said “Put those rings on everyone, or she will die”. “Put them on. Please” Karia said, with a low inaudible voice, she started crying. “And you too” He gave her the ring from his pocket.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="883" data-line-end="884">“You are an asshole…” Mary said, annoyed and angry. “Bla, Bla, Bla. Do as I say, or you will regret”. Soon all the girls wore the rings. He pressed a button on the remote to test if everything was working fine. All the girls screamed as he pressed the button.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="885" data-line-end="886">—-------</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="887" data-line-end="889">For a few months KARAM gave some weird tasks for the girls to complete in the given time, and they had to do whatever was said to them. They receive the task on their cellphones with the given time to complete and if they don’t do the task a separate button only for them is pressed and they got what they deserve. KARAM made them his puppets.<br>
        The After-effects of Suicide</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="890" data-line-end="891">All seven of them were sitting in a park near Karia’s house, staring at their ring and discussing how Karia had died. Most of them believed that her death was a suicide. Mary, Edon and Olima thought that KARAM might have killed her, he must be taking revenge.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="892" data-line-end="893">“Saphira took her own life… So he might have created a situation for her, so she took her own life” Edon said, some weird stuff is going on in her mind, her assumptions are thought to be correct by everyone else. “I think it was a suicide, I don’t know why but I feel like it was an suicide&quot; Pamela said, her words were like a bullet into the hearts of everyone around her.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="894" data-line-end="895">“I think Pamela is right. Edon might be correct as well, because in both the cases her death was considered to be a suicide” Josie spoke in a low voice.Olima and Mary both looked at each other, they knew that Pamela had been right about something before. They didn’t want to believe what she was saying now. But they could not deny the truth.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="896" data-line-end="897">“Whatever Pam. It’s definitely Karam, it is his plan and he wants to take revenge on us all. It is definitely a murder&quot; Edon said. Everyone somehow agreed with Edon, but Pamela and Josephine(Josie) didn’t agree with her.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="898" data-line-end="899">“No Edon, you’re wrong. Karam did not kill her. He was not scared of doing anything in front of us. If he wanted to kill her then he would have done it in front of us all. You might be right in a way that he is somehow involved in the cause of her death, but still it is a suicide not a murder” Pamela said, looking Edon in her eyes.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="900" data-line-end="901">As soon as Edon tried to speak for herself, someone from behind said, “Hey girls” everyone looked at him, “I am Adam. I can help you with your issue… I am sorry but I listened to what you guys are talking about” He said, smiling. “ooh , so Mr. Adam. How would you help us, and why would you do that? Do you know us?” Mary asked him, looking at her suspiciously.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="902" data-line-end="903">“I am a private detective. I am working on Karia’s case, secretly. I can help you guys find this KARAM guy, the real one. When I find him, you can ask him if Karia took her own life or he killed her. You guys have to tell me everything that happened with you guys” Adam replied to her question.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="904" data-line-end="905">“How will we trust you? And why should we trust you? Why should we tell you everything that happened with us? We don’t even know who you are. You might be a murderer yourself” Edon said, squinting her eyes.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="906" data-line-end="907">“That’s not true, I am not a murderer. You guys can come to my place tomorrow morning and meet me. Then you can decide whether to trust me or not. But I promise you, that I will help you guys in finding KARAM” Adam said and gave her a card with his name, number and address.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="908" data-line-end="910">—-------<br>
        Around 4PM, All seven of them reached the given address on the card. They were presented with the drinks by Adam’s maid. They all became relaxed and comfortable with him, and soon they started talking like they all knew each other very well. “So you girls, have you decided to trust me or not?” Adam asked them when they were finished with the drinks and other small talks.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="911" data-line-end="912">“Yes, we will trust you, but first let us tell you everything that has happened between us and KARAM. We will also tell you about Saphira. She was the main person in all this mess” Edon said, looking at him. Adam coughed as he heard Saphira’s name “Who is She?”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="913" data-line-end="914">“Saphira… She was KARAM’s wife. They both loved each other too much. Saphira killed herself” Libby replied. “Ohhh, I see. That’s sad. So why did she kill herself? Did she die because of KARAM?&quot; Adam asked. All the girls felt ashamed of telling him that they all were the reason of Saphira’s suicide.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="915" data-line-end="916">“No, she killed herself because of us” Edon finally spoke up, looking away from  Adam. “We bullied her a lot. We always make fun of her in front of her kindergarten students, and her few friends”. Adam nodded, understanding what Edon meant. “We were always fighting with her. I remember, once I got angry with someone, and punched her in the face. I left her there bleeding and crying”. Adam looked at Edon, he could see tears in her eyes.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="917" data-line-end="919">“We were the reason for her death. I am really sorry for her death” everyone looked at Edon.<br>
        The End of Him</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="920" data-line-end="932">April 8, 2019, Monday.<br>
        “We have to end this game. You won’t have to face KARAM’s tortures anymore” Adam said. The girls and Adam were sitting near the Earl of Sandwich, discussing the security measures they should take to be safe from the attack. “It is useless. We tried many things, he is always a step ahead of us” Marry said, holding an apple in one hand and the sandwich roll in another.<br>
        “What if we create some sort of diversion? What if we distract him? He might get caught up with that and leave us alone for some time” Joseling gave an idea. Everyone laughed, “You think KARAM would fall for that…” Pamela said, smiling.<br>
        Adam was listening to their conversation, when suddenly feel that someone was spying on them. “I am going to the washroom” Edon said, she stood up and walked towards the backside of Earl of Sandwich. “I have to call someone. You guys sit here and wait” Adam walked a few meters away from the girls.<br>
        He reached his phone, opened it and dialed a number. It rang for some time before he heard a voice. “Hello?” It was officer Hector on the other side. Adam called the police because he saw a man in black jacked walking towards the back of Earl of Sandwich, the man was definitely behind Edon.<br>
        “Hector! I need you to do something for me. Please come to the back of Earl of Sandwich” Adam said, his voice shaking. Officer Hector arrived at the place within minutes. He took out his gun, walked towards the back side of the place. “Don’t move. You are under arrest” officer Hector shouts, with his gun pointed towards the black jacket man.<br>
        The man in the back jacket ran towards the Parkman, Bandstand. It’s easier for him to hide somewhere in the dark. The rain had started, and it was making the ground look like a lake, which was creating difficulty for him to run.<br>
        As he reached closer to the bandstand, officer Hector shouted,”Stop it, or I’ll shoot”. Rain is also creating difficulty for him to listen to the clear sound of what the officer Hector was saying.<br>
        Officer had shot the bullet, and it hit the black jacket man in the middle of the skull from the back. He fell down on his face, motionless, and the blood was getting washed away in the rain. Officer Hector called the police jeep to take away the body.<br>
        Edon got curious, and she went closer to the body. “Your game is over” She whispered. She tried to check his identity, but officer Hector said ”don’t touch the body”. “I just want to see his face and ID card,” Edon asked Politely.<br>
        Officer turned the body over and took out his wallet to show the ID to the girl, “Kevin Anderson” Edon read aloud his name. Everyone of them came close to the body to see the face of evil, which haunted them for years.<br>
        After unfolding the mystery of KARAM, channel 25 and other news channels and TV show hosts were behind the event to interview the girls and others who were directly or indirectly involved with KARAM.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="933" data-line-end="934">At first Olima Gerald agreed to give the interview but only on the condition that the interview should be taken in her own home. Lisa Francis, the channel 25 news anchor, had conducted the interview.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="935" data-line-end="936">“So madam can you please tell us something about yourself and your family?” Lisa asked politely.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="937" data-line-end="938">“Yaa… I was born in Texas Fredericksburg. In Texas I live with my two older brothers, Darrin and Morris, and my parents. I am the youngest and Darrin is the oldest. Today I am about two thousand miles away from them, I miss them all. Now I am planning to go back because I don’t want to continue my studies here… This place is going to haunt me now”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="939" data-line-end="940">“Thank you very much. Now… Do KARAM, or do I say Kevin Anderson, look exactly like Karia once said in her video?” Lisa asked another question, with a little bit of curiosity on her face. She was continuously looking at the documents in her hand.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="941" data-line-end="942">“Why would she tell the wrong description of KARAM?. Karia told exactly how he looks, her description was perfect. She was too scared of KARAM, and she lost her mind after the video. We all first thought  that after the video Karia made and what we had made… It would be easier for KARAM to blend in and get lost forever, but luck was on our side”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="943" data-line-end="944">“Okay madam… Please tell us about your first encounter with KARAM” Lisa asked. After the camera paused and started again after some time.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="945" data-line-end="946">“I actually did not have any solo encounters with KARAM, like Karia, Pam and Edon did. I first saw him in front of my eyes in the glass penthouse in Orlando, when he was there with the knife on Karia’s throat, forcing us to wear this ring. It was the only live encounter that I have with KARAM. Before the ring he sent us messages on the piece of paper, on which the ink disappeared as we planned to show it to the police, or we got pop up messages on phones or laptops”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="947" data-line-end="948">“What about that ring in your hand, can you show that to the camera?” Lisa liked the ring.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="949" data-line-end="950">“It’s a shock trigger. You can see it with your eyes now, it won’t show on camera. Sorry… But it is what it is, I can not change that”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="951" data-line-end="952">“Why are you not taking it off now? Kevin is dead now”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="953" data-line-end="954">“I will take it off for sure, after this interview… It was sad that we could not take it off when he was alive, and I am serious about that… Now I am somehow connected with this ring, it was a part of me for so long”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="955" data-line-end="956">“Thank you very much for your time madam” Lisa Thanked her with a fake smile.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="957" data-line-end="959">Olima took the camera off from her shirt, whipped her face with her hand and started to drink something from her mug which was sitting there on the table till the start of the interview. “It’s cold” She whispered to herself, stood up and went to the kitchen.<br>
        She was sitting on the porch of her old house, staring at the sky. She got a call from an unknown number. She was scared at first but she remembered suddenly that it was not the time to be scared, KARAM was no more, it cannot be a threat call or some task thing.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="960" data-line-end="961">It was a call from channel 25. “Hello Miss Pamela Smith. We got your number from your facebook profile. I am Lisa Francis from channel 25. I am here to request you for an interview. Are you available” Lisa said the whole sentence in one breath. “Yes. I am free this evening. I can give you the interview. Where is the interview happening?” Pamela agreed without the second thought.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="962" data-line-end="963">“The interview would be in our studio and I would be thankful if you could come here between 3:00PM to 6:00PM” Lisa said with her usual fake smile, and hung up the phone.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="964" data-line-end="965">Around 4 o’clock Pamela reached channel 25 building. Inside the building she didn’t know where to go for the interview. She asked everyone where the interview will happen but nobody knows about the interview and even Lisa didn’t tell her where it would happen. It was a personal interview.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="966" data-line-end="967">Pamela sent the message on the same number from which she got the call from. After ten seconds she got a reply, “come to the fourth floor, news room”. Pamela replied “Thanks” and went upstairs.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="968" data-line-end="969">The interview started at 4:30PM.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="970" data-line-end="971">Lisa started with the same question, the one she asked Olima. “Hello madam, please tell us something about yourself and your family” She was much more relaxed then her last interview.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="972" data-line-end="973">“I am a student and an actress of kids TV shows. I was born in London, England. Now I live here in Boston with my mom and my younger sister June”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="974" data-line-end="975">“Nice, we both have something in common .I have a younger sister named June too. You should bring her with you here. I would be so happy to see her” Lisa asked her, but this time with a real smile on her face.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="976" data-line-end="977">“I am more than happy to bring her with me, but I can not do that… She went back to London with dad for her college studies. She and dad will be here in Boston soon after her graduation. I think this year was her last year of graduation”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="978" data-line-end="979">“Okay…Now can you please tell us how was your first encounter with KARAM?” Lisa asked, she was much more interested in this interview than before.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="980" data-line-end="981">“So…. When I was in Orlando. meet and greet. It was 2014. When June and I were outside enjoying our day, we decided to do some shopping in…  I actually forgot the name of the mall. Forget that… When my sister and I came out of the mall… It was the first time when I saw him that close. He dragged me towards the corner of the building, and he was lucky at that moment that my sister didn’t see him dragging me. He didn’t do anything, he walked away when the guard shouted “what are you guys doing there?”. He just wanted to give me a small box, it looks like a ring box to me, the same one I am wearing now”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="982" data-line-end="983">“As you said, you have seen him too close, so can you tell us about him? How he acts, how he moves, his appearance in close… you got what I am saying?” Lisa asked this after a pause, writing down something on a notepad.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="984" data-line-end="985">“Yes, I understand what you are trying to ask… I don’t know what it is , but there is something going on deep inside him. When he was in our hotel room, after he walked away. He ordered June to go somewhere else, he didn’t hurt my sister, he didn’t even touch me in front of my sister. He is bad and ethical at the same time. He just asked me, as he was twisting my arm, ‘Why did you do that’. I don’t know why he was asking that question, and this time he didn’t give me the box that he was trying to give me before…”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="986" data-line-end="987">“What happened next?” Lisa asked, she was curious.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="988" data-line-end="990">“The room service guy rang the doorbell. He freed my arm. I went for the door, and when I came back he was gone. I don’t know how… Karia used to say that He is a ghost”.<br>
        The Motive?:</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="991" data-line-end="992">“Sir I have a question to ask. It’s personal” Mandarin said, staring at the list with curiosity. “Go on. Ask that bloody personal question” KARAM said with a straight face. “Sir, you are not an evil person. Why do you want to have control over these girls? What you are doing can mentally torture them. What is the Motive behind all this?” Maedrian asked with any hesitation.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="993" data-line-end="994">“Well, Maedrian. There was someone I loved, and there were several girls, the same girls who were on the list in your hand. They bullied my love and some other girls physically, and mentally. They are so called thugs of cyberbullying. My love was a content creator. Her work is better that theirs, and this thing hurt them and they started bullying her, first mentally and then physically. She died”. KARAM stopped talking, heads down.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="995" data-line-end="996">“Who was her? And why didn’t she go to the police…” Maedrian asked, looking at KARAM being sad. “You know Saphira?” KARAM asked. “No sir.” She replied. “Then this is enough for you to know”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="997" data-line-end="998">“Saphira’s suicide was actually a murder but police said she got crazy, she was taking the medicines and took her own life. Now I will show them, What a actuall mental torture looks like” KARAM said when Maedrian was about to walk outside the apartment.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="999" data-line-end="1000">It’s Wednesday, 2012. There was a knock at the door. Olima opened the door.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1001" data-line-end="1002">There was a short heighted man with a black mask on his face. He gave an envelope to Olima and said, “It was for miss Olima”. This was the same envelope as Libby’s. “Who sent it?” Olima asked, taking the envelope from him. The man in black mask didn’t reply, he simply walked away.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1003" data-line-end="1004">WARNING</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1005" data-line-end="1006">A huge W.A.R.N.I.N.G was written on the front of the letter. Olima knew it was from KARAM because there is no one else who will give her the warning of any kind. There was a message on the backside of the letter, similar as everyone else had, “Stop making videos or you will regret”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1007" data-line-end="1008">In the evening around 5:00PM Olima messaged Libby, Mary and Edon “Hey!… Can we meet?? In front of Bacon Hill Cleaners. I would be in my car”. All of them replied instantly. They all would be there in about fifteen to twenty minutes.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1009" data-line-end="1010">They all had to wait for Libby, she would be there in about thirty minutes, but luckily she was there right in front of the car, knocking at the window twenty five minutes after she had sent the message. Now the time was around 5:35PM.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1011" data-line-end="1012">Olima drove and stopped in front of an alley in Ravera street. “I got this letter today. I opened it and there was a warning on it… and the mysterious thing was that, as I opened it and read it the ink removed itself… Something is not right” Olima said, in one breath. “We all got the letter too, and the ink removed itself, as you said” Everyone replied.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1013" data-line-end="1014">“We have to go to the police right now,”  Olima said, shivering. “First of all, the police will not believe us if we show him the empty piece of paper. Second of all, Whoever this person is? That person is a coward. He, She or whatever, can not do anything. So you all go home and relax” Mary said with anger.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1015" data-line-end="1016">Everyone stepped out of the car and walked towards their homes. Something was disturbing Olima from the inside, she drove to the police station alone with the mysterious letter.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1017" data-line-end="1019">Hello, officer…Hector, Olima read the nameplate on the officer’s sweater. “Yes mam?” Hector said, in a serious tone. “I want to write a complaint,” Olima said, looking up and down continuously. “Of course man. Follow me to my office” Hector said, this time with a smile.<br>
        Hector opened the complaint register and was about to write what Olima was about to say. “Someone wrote a warning letter to me and my friends, that we should stop making videos or else something will happen that we will regret… There was now nothing on the letter, The ink disappeared” Olima put the envelope on the desk and moved it closer to him.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1020" data-line-end="1021">“It would be some kind of prank mam. You should go home and take some rest. If anything happens you can come back here anytime” There is a voice message on Walkie Talkie for him. Hector put on his hat and walked outside his office.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1023" data-line-end="1024">Next day morning Olima told her mom about each and everything that had happened last evening, word by word. Everything seemed normal at first right before her mom walked inside the room, not saying a single word to her.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1025" data-line-end="1026">“Hello…”, there was a call dialed to the police station. Olima listened to each and everything her mom said on the phone.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1027" data-line-end="1028">Mrs Gerald walked outside the room, “Come on, we are going to the police station” She ordered Olima. “Mom, listen we…” Olima is trying to speak but her mom didn’t even bother to listen to a single word she was trying to say.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1029" data-line-end="1030">“What is happening? First someone broke into our house and then my daughter and her friend got abducted by some KARAM guy. Now that guy is free somewhere, laughing at us…” Mrs Gerald continuously spoke gibberish, throwing statements on officer Hector.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1031" data-line-end="1032">“Mam I completely understand your problem but we can not do anything.The car in which you daughter and friends were taken, belongs to your daughter. You can see the CCTV footage, there is no sign of them being forced into the car. They go inside the car by themselves” Hector said politely.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1033" data-line-end="1034">“And what about the damages? There is definitely someone behind all that mess” Mrs Gerald said, staring at  officer Hector. “They were some drunk guys. They are now in the cell. We caught them last night” Hector replied.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1035" data-line-end="1036">Mrs Gerald didn’t say a word for a moment, then she said, again staring towards officer Hector “Get up, we are going back to our family home. This place is no more safe for you to live” Mrs Gerald said to Olima, but in reality she taunts officer Hector.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1037" data-line-end="1038">“But mom I don’t wanna go. I have no friends back there. I have to complete my studies here… I promise I’ll go back after it’s done. Please” Olima innocently asked. “Okay, but you have to keep your promise.” Mrs Gerald agtreed.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1039" data-line-end="1040">“Okay mom I promise” Olima felt relieved.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1041" data-line-end="1043">“KARAM… This guy is too smart. He took my car somehow so nobody can blame him for being the intruder. He had something bad going on in his mind…” Olima is talking to herself, and they all are listening carefully.<br>
        “He is an idiot who loves to destroy things to show his power. He wants us to be scared of him. This is a game of terror, nothing else” Mary said, throwing a flower on the ground.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1044" data-line-end="1045">“Listen guys. He never tortured us. First thing, we were loosely tied when we were dragged towards some sort of vehicle… Second thing is that he wants to teach us a lesson for something that we did. Something wrong” Pamela said, biting her nails. “But what is something that we did wrong?” Libby said, she’s confused. “I don’t know what that something is, but there must be something that we have to find out soon before he performs another threat act” Pamela said, staring at the ground.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1046" data-line-end="1047">That night when lying on her bed, Edon thought about what Pamela had said before. “There is something that had been done by mistake or intentionally” She thought, but this was not the problem. The question is WHAT?</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1048" data-line-end="1049">This big W.H.A.T is creating the problem, first for Libby and now for her. Pamela had created an almost unsolvable question. The most problematic question for these girls.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1050" data-line-end="1051">THEY DID SOMETHING, SOMETHING NOT SO GOOD.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1052" data-line-end="1053">The Police</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1054" data-line-end="1055">There was a knock at the door. “Come in. The door is open” Hector said.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1056" data-line-end="1057">“I want to show you something sir” Hannah came inside in a rush, with the laptop in hand. She continued.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1058" data-line-end="1059">“Look at this data sir. The KARAM thing is getting viral. Everyone in the area is doing crime under the KARAM umbrella. This stuff is getting huge after Karia’s video, and now the other girls are making these types of videos too”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1060" data-line-end="1061">“Who are these girls? Are these videos fake?” Hannah asked, with confusion.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1062" data-line-end="1063">“These are the same girls who reported about KARAM,” Hector replied with a straight face. “If there is any real KARAM, believe me sir, now it would be impossible to track the real one” Hannah said.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1064" data-line-end="1065">“So what do you think of this then? Should we go public with this? We can’t ignore this anymore” Hector asked her.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1066" data-line-end="1067">Hannah thought for a moment. “I don’t know, but I have an idea… Let’s keep this thing a secret until we find out the truth”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1068" data-line-end="1069">“What?” Hector asked, looking at her, curious. “We should ask the girls to come here tomorrow morning. They will tell us if they were tricked or not.” Hannah said, writing something in the notepad.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1070" data-line-end="1071">“But how will we get them to come here?” Hector asked, still confused.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1072" data-line-end="1073">“Sir, that’s where my idea comes into play. We call them for routine investigation, but don’t tell them about this KARAM thing happening. Let’s see how it goes” Hannah replied, with a grin on her face.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1074" data-line-end="1075">—-------</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1076" data-line-end="1077">The next day, everyone gathered in the meeting room. The girls were sitting in a circle, looking nervous. Hannah and Hector were standing in front of them.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1078" data-line-end="1079">&quot;Girls, thank you for coming here today. You guys are really brave to come forward like this. Now, I am going to explain to you what happened yesterday. If anyone has anything else to say, please speak up. If not, I’ll begin with the story” Hannah said.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1080" data-line-end="1081">Hannah continued “There was a video going viral about KARAM, that you guys have posted a few days back. Now there is this news that local gangs are doing different sorts of crime behind the name of this KARAM. If there is actually a KARAM, you guys are going to help our team to catch him, and if you guys made up any story about this KARAM thing to get views and fame, believe me that you guys are going to regret this”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1082" data-line-end="1083">“It was my mistake. If I hadn’t made the video in the first place, nothing would have happened” Karia said, looking down at the floor, ashamed of what she had done. “I know that making that video was a mistake, but everything in the video was true. I didn’t lie” Karia said, looking towards Hannah, tears dropping from her eyes. “Are you okay? I didn’t mean to scare you” Hannah asked, she walked towards Karia, held her hands up in front of Karia’s face. “I know that what you have done is really stupid, but it’s okay” Hannah said, and then she walked towards the other girls who was looking at them talking.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1084" data-line-end="1085">Hector was standing in front of them, quietly listening to them like he was observing them, trying to find something hidden in their silence. “What about you guys. Why did you upload the video? Is this a publicity stunt or… ” Hannah asked them. “We did it because KARAM made us do that, and if we don’t do what he says, we get an electric shock… We don’t want this video to go viral” Pamela said on behalf of Olima and Edon. “We don’t want that video to be spread anymore. It was wrong what we did, and we apologize” Karia said, she looked up at Hannah, trying to catch her eye.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1086" data-line-end="1087">“I want this KARAM. Dead or Alive” Hector finally spoke.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1088" data-line-end="1089">The Suicide</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1090" data-line-end="1091">Karia felt so guilty after she came back from the police station. She was ashamed of making that expose video, she accidentally gave KARAM a chance to disguise himself. Other girls don’t talk to her anymore, everyone thought that she was involved with KARAM.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1092" data-line-end="1093">Karia herself thought that she is an evil person, and everything that happened was just because of her stupid mistake. Karia is so embarrassed. She could only hide under her bed now, trying not to be seen by anyone.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1094" data-line-end="1095">She exposes KARAM because she always hated him. Her stupid mistake is still hurting her. Even her best friend Matilda has avoided talking to her since. She is trying her best to get out of the mess she is now in.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1096" data-line-end="1097">Karia is very upset and confused by all the things that happened. Her fears were proved true. She unexpectedly got involved with the people who were doing crimes all around the city. Criminals are taking advantage of Karia’s video. As a result, she can never run away from this reality. She now understands what her life would have been like without her friends. She can never forget what happened.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1098" data-line-end="1099">She is scared of going outside alone. She doesn’t know how to deal with the situation she is in right now. She wants to tell her parents about it but she knows they won’t believe her. She has no choice but to face the consequences.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1100" data-line-end="1101">—-------</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1102" data-line-end="1103">“KARIA! ARE YOU OKAY?” Karia saw a text message from Matilda. Her heart suddenly stops beating for a moment when she hears her name being called by her only best friend.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1104" data-line-end="1105">Karia wanted to reply, but her mind and body didn’t allow it. She dropped the phone on the bed and walked outside the room. She is afraid to face anyone, afraid to talk to anyone. She thought that if she goes close to anyone, something bad could happen. She felt so alone for the first time in her life.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1106" data-line-end="1107">Karia walked away from her room and went out to the balcony. The air is so fresh and cool. She wanted to get out, somewhere unknown. It’s impossible for her to walk back into the room when Matilda has messaged her. She walked on the balcony and took some deep breaths. She was trying to concentrate on her own thoughts and didn’t want to pay attention to the loud street noises.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1108" data-line-end="1109">She wanted to end everything, and she did. She can’t handle the pain anymore. These moments are so difficult for her. Karia, with a heavy heart, jumps right off of her balcony. Her body lay lifeless on the main road of lime street.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1110" data-line-end="1111">—-------</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1112" data-line-end="1113">Next day morning there was news all around Boston. Karia’s suicide was considered to be a murder, and blame was on KARAM, but nobody knows how he did that. There is still a fifty percent chance that people might think that Karia took her own life.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1114" data-line-end="1115">On news her sister and mother continuously blames KARAM for her murder. KARAM is a man who is well-known in Boston for his mysterious ways. He has never been caught or identified by any of the police. People have started calling him the ‘Ghost of Lime Street’.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1116" data-line-end="1117">Few kilometers away from where Karia was found dead, KARAM was in his room, sitting on the couch, watching the news. She saw that one of the bullies of Saphira had died. He never wanted to kill anybody, his only mission was to teach them a lesson. KARAM called Maedrian “Things are getting out of control. Find a way to stop this mess”. “Okay sir I will do something” Maedrian said from the other end.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1118" data-line-end="1119">The viral video</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1120" data-line-end="1121">Few weeks after the release of Karia’s video, “KARAM expose” there was news on Television that the KARAM conspiracy was getting huge and huge after what Karia did in one of her videos. Boys and girls around Boston, Beacon street and the areas around it were dressing like him. KARAM had become an idol for the younger generation, especially for boys.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1122" data-line-end="1123">“Who dared to talk about me?” KARAM shouted at Maedrian. “It is that stupid ghost girl Karia. She made a video about you. I have mailed you the original video” Maedrian said, with a childish face.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1124" data-line-end="1125">KARAM had become a trending topic on youtube and he was becoming the center of attraction in the United States of America. As KARAM was a hidden personality, people might use his identity to commit crime.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1126" data-line-end="1127">A plan clicked KARAM’s mind. “We should use this conspiracy for our benefit” KARAM said to Maedrian, with his usual evil expressions. “How can we do that, sir?” Maedrian asked in confusion.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1128" data-line-end="1129">“You know…. MEDIA IS POWER, WE HAVE TO USE THIS POWER” KARAM said all this, looking straight in Maedrian’s eyes</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1130" data-line-end="1131">The video was flying over the internet. KARAM has become the trending topic among the society. Every social media was talking about him, sharing Karia’s video. Every shopping mall was selling KARAM costumes. There were websites and mobile applications for him.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1132" data-line-end="1133">Karia hid behind the screen. She knew that she had made the biggest mistake of her life. Now the police was forced to get active because KARAM was not getting viral only on the younger side of the society. As he was a criminal too, he had become an idol for most of murderers and thiefs aswell.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1134" data-line-end="1136">BEFORE THERE WAS ONLY ONE. BUT NOW THERE ARE SO MANY OF HIM…<br>
        The year</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1137" data-line-end="1138">Almost a year has passed since the first meet and greet. There are no signs of KARAM. Some of the girls thought he was dead, and some thought he has no more interest in torturing them. The main thing is that everyone was now relaxed. There was no KARAM for them and they could do whatever they wanted.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1139" data-line-end="1140">YouTube was blooming with the content of these little ladies. Karia’s diary issue was abandoned, no one talks about that anymore. Everything seems as it was before the arrival of KARAM. Police once said that someone must have been playing pranks with them, evil pranks. For girls KARAM was not a prank, he was a horror nightmare for them.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1141" data-line-end="1142">The girl’s family told them to forget about what had happened to them. KARAM became the past for them and they all forgot him like he was a nightmare, a nightmare which comes once in a lifetime and sticks with you forever as a bad memory.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1143" data-line-end="1144">Everything went normal until in August, 2017 the girls got an email for a second meet and greet, the same one as before, agin in Orlando, Florida. There is something fishy, the email looks wrong. The email was all the same but this time they all were invited to a penthouse as special guests, and all of them had to be there.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1145" data-line-end="1146">Edon pointed out the fishiness in the mail when they were sitting in the cafe, reading the mail together. “There is something wrong. Why would they give us a special offer? Our views this time were less than before. Why didn’t they give us the special offer before?” Edon said, confused. “Don’t worry. They wanted to give us the offer the first time, there would be some problem then, so now they are giving us the offer. Don’t worry, just chill” Matilda said, sipping coffee.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1147" data-line-end="1148">Finally all of them agreed, and this time each one of them were going to the meet and greet.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1150" data-line-end="1151">There are So Many of Him</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1152" data-line-end="1153">It is 11:00 AM in the morning.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1154" data-line-end="1158">Edon, Pamela, Edon and Olima were standing in the PUBLIC ALLEY 301, talking about the blunder that Karia did a few days ago.<br>
        “Somebody needs to stop that bitch, or she will destroy us all” Edon was furious, she continued to curse her more and more.<br>
        Olima was quiet, looking down at the floor, thinking of something too deep, like she was making a great plan in her mind.<br>
        “Cool down Edon, it is now useless to curse at her. What can we do now?” Pamela spoke, in a sad tone.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1159" data-line-end="1160">All of them screamed at once, their ring gave them a shock. “No task was given to us. Why this shock?” Olima said, they all are in pain. “Now He’s gonna give us pain, and for no reason… because of this Karia” Edon was glowing red.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1161" data-line-end="1162">So many girls and boys walked through this alley, many of them were dressed as KARAM. All of them eyed each other in shock. “Is this halloween or something???” Pamela asked, scratching her head. Everybody was quiet the moment,  “Are you guys serious.What are we going to do now?.. THERE ARE SO MANY OF HIM” Mary finally spoke.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1163" data-line-end="1170">All of them marched straight to the main road to see what was going on.<br>
        There are so many people dressed as KARAM.<br>
        “KARAM would have been laughing at us right now.” Olima whispered to herself.<br>
        DING… All of them got the text on their phones.<br>
        TO ALL: MAKE A LIVE VIDEO TO SUPPORT WHAT KARIA DID. YOU ALL HAVE SEVEN HOURS TO COMPLETE THE TASK.<br>
        “Hey MR. KARAM. If you are listening… Listen carefully. I am not scared of you, and I am not going to make any video” Edon said and started walking towards her building. Few steps ahead everyone got a shock again, the shock was longer this time for Edon.<br>
        “He is smart. He wants to make more people like him, so no one can ever find him. We can not do anything to him” Mary said, almost going to punch her palm.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1171" data-line-end="1173">Everyone around these girls are now a copy of KARAM, even if the person next to them is the real one, they won’t even have a slight doubt on him.<br>
        Now everyone started having doubt on Karia that She is with KARAM</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1174" data-line-end="1175">Now it is 6:30 PM in the evening.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1176" data-line-end="1178">There is only thirty minutes left until the next brutal shock for them. “What about the other girls? If they can’t make it, we will all get an electric shock” Olima looks worried.<br>
        All of them were live on YOUTUBE at once.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1179" data-line-end="1180">“I don’t care if you all hate me, or what everyone else is gonna think about me, I am not waiting I am still gonna make this video” Edon yelled. “It’s okay Edon, just do what you gotta do, we all are here for you” Pamela said.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1181" data-line-end="1182">Good job little ladies, they got a text message from KARAM. Few minutes later when they all felt relieved, another message came. Be active girls, your next task will be given to you anytime.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1183" data-line-end="1186">The girls went back home. They are exhausted.<br>
        “We need to think of something fast, otherwise, we are all gonna die,” Edon said.<br>
        “How can we beat him?</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1187" data-line-end="1188">Who is Saphira? And the plan</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1189" data-line-end="1190">On the very next day of the shock ring plan, KARAM was sitting on the couch in the lounge, watching a video on her tab. There was a video of a girl on her tab, it was a video of her wife Saphira. He presses play, and the video starts with an introduction.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1191" data-line-end="1192">“Hello Guys! My name is Saphira Kristina Andrew. This is my first video for youtube. I am 17 years old, almost 18. I am a single child. I am a student of Boston College, and a part time kindergarten teacher. I love kids. I am engaged to a handsome guy named Keith. I want to be the happiest person in the whole universe”. Saphira never uploaded this video.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1193" data-line-end="1194">KARAM was going through the laptop that once was used by the most famous blog writer and content creator Saphira K Andrew. As he was lost in the memories of his beautiful wife, someone knocked at the door. It’s Maedrian.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1195" data-line-end="1196">“Sir, I have a great plan,” Maedrian said, in a hurry, smiling. “What are you talking about? What plan?” KARAM asked, staring at her. “How to make the girls wear these rings” Maedrian replied, she showed him the rings in her hand, in a metal box.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1197" data-line-end="1198">“Okay! Now what should we do?? Don’t say that I should go and kidnap them all” KARAM asked, in confusion. Maedrian was too difficult to be understood.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1199" data-line-end="1200">Maedrian started talking, giving him the metal box “First thing… You have to make those girls be in one place, because…. When you put the rings on their fingers, I will then execute the ring shock function from here and the light on the remote will turn green. If any of the ring left unused, it will not work again, and I have to make the new ones for the other girls”</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1201" data-line-end="1203">“You are so evil…” KARAM smiled, throwing and catching the metal box. “I’m not evil, just smarter than a normal person” Maedrian smirked. After a long pause, Maedrian continued with her plan “Few days from now, all the girls will get an email for meet and greet. You will go there and find a time when they all were together, and the rest of the plan you already know”.<br>
        “Hello!  I am Lisa Francis from Channel 24, Boston news, Massachusetts”</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1204" data-line-end="1205">“Tonight we have some new information about the most wanted vandal of Boston KARAM, or as some people say, the killer of nineteen years old teenager Karia Williams. In the past few days Olima Gerald, a victim of KARAM posted a video titled `` He is back on her youtube channel which got millions of views in a few days. Previously it was said that Kevin Anderson died, and he was supposed to be the real KARAM, but now Olima Gerald claims that Kevin Anderson cannot be KARAM. We are about to play a clip of her video, just after a short commercial break”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1206" data-line-end="1207">Lisa stood up from her chair and walked outside the recording room, for something to eat and drink. On her way back to the recording room, she thought for a moment before saying it on camera, He is still alive… He must be a popular handsome guy.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1208" data-line-end="1209">“Camera rolling” the camera guy shouts.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1210" data-line-end="1212">“So we are back with the new… Olima claims that Kevin could not be KARAM. He is still alive and the reason for this is that someone is giving them tasks to complete, and it must be him because no one else has the control over the rings. If Kevin Anderson is not KARAM so who is he? Where is he? What is his motive?<br>
        Stay tuned for the updates, and thank you so much for watching. BYE”</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1213" data-line-end="1214">“This KARAM guy is a big chaos”, Lisa whispered to herself.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1215" data-line-end="1216">“That guy is a female hater. You should watch your steps back home” the camera guy jokes.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1217" data-line-end="1218">“Blah, Blah, Blah Darrell” Lisa replied.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1219" data-line-end="1220">Officer Hector Ross and officer Hanna Ortiz standing near the outer area of the Boston police department, talking about the recent news about KARAM. Hector is about to say something to Hanna but she is unable to hear a word because of the noise in the background. Hector gave her the sign to follow him as he walked towards his office, and Hanna followed him.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1221" data-line-end="1222">“Did you or anyone in this department, search for anything related to Kevin Anderson?” Hector asked her.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1223" data-line-end="1224">“Sir I have checked Kevin’s background” Hanna said, giving officer Hector the case file.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1225" data-line-end="1226">“What did you get?” He asked, taking the file and sat down in his chair.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1227" data-line-end="1228">“KARAM torture the girls and he is somehow realted to them, and he had motive. Kevin on other hand, who was considered to be KARAM, he is not even a little bit related to any of the girl, and Kevin dose not have any motive to torture these girls. There is nothing to hundred percent prove that Kevin Anderson is the real KARAM” She explained.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1229" data-line-end="1230">“…Is Kevin and KARM, different? Why would he, Kevin torture these girls? What would be his motive?” Hanna Ortiz whispered to herself, she was getting confused.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1231" data-line-end="1232">“He played us well. But how can he still be alive? I shot him myself” Hector said, stood up and started pacing back and forth in the office.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1233" data-line-end="1234">&quot;He must have planted someone who looks like him, or the girls must have been lying for fake publicity. You should try to remember what happened that day. I mean everything,” the Hanna said, standing straight.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1235" data-line-end="1236">Officer Hector didn’t say a word, just went to flash back.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1237" data-line-end="1238">Hector Ross was walking back to the police department from a random coffee stall in Boston, Beacon street, holding a cup of coffee, and on his way back, he got a call.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1239" data-line-end="1240">&quot;Hello! this is officer Hector speaking from the Boston police department,“ he said.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1241" data-line-end="1242">“Hello officer this is Adam. I am calling from the Earl of Sandwich, in the park. There is someone following us. He is going to hurt one of the girls with me. Please come here right now”</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1243" data-line-end="1244">“I’ll be there, don’t worry” He replied</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1245" data-line-end="1246">“I remember clearly, there was a man in the back jacket. He ran towards the Parkman Bandstand… I shouted, stop but he didn’t so I shot him, and he died right in front of me and so many people” Hector talks out loud, thinking.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1247" data-line-end="1250">“Who is this Adam? Where is he?” Hannah asked.<br>
        “I don’t know actually. I saw his face but I remember anything about him. I was in a hurry to catch that guy” Hector said, Hannah put him in a big confusion.<br>
        “You should check your phone. If he called you there must be his number in your phone” Hannah said, still standing straight in the same place as before.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1251" data-line-end="1252">“Yah! Right” Hector took out his phone and scrolled down to the same date of that incident. “There you go. That is his number. He is the only one who calls me that day” Hector handed the phone to Hannah, without telling her what to do with it.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1253" data-line-end="1254">“I have a question sir” Hannah asked, taking the phone in her hand, she was confused.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1255" data-line-end="1256">“Yes! What’s the question”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1257" data-line-end="1258">“How did he call you on your personal cell phone? Where did he get your number?” Hannah asked, finally moved from her fixed spot, “… and what should I do with this phone?”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1259" data-line-end="1260">“Wait a second… You are right. How did he get my number and why did he call me on my cell phone” Hector got confused again. He grabs his phone from her hand and rushes outside. Hannah created too much confusion for him.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1261" data-line-end="1262">Officer Hector sprinted towards the cyber department. He gave them the phone, “trace this number 617 555 0144 fast”. He wants to verify the number, to check if it belongs to Adam or not. He walked outside to get some air.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1263" data-line-end="1264">“How did I not remember his face?” Hector talks to himself. Now he has the option to wait for the call trace or he can go ask the girls about Adam.</p>
        <hr>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1266" data-line-end="1267">Around forty minutes later a man tapped Hector’s shoulders when he was sitting on the bench outside the police department.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1268" data-line-end="1269">“There you go sir. The number belongs to Adam Walter, the who” The man said.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1270" data-line-end="1271">“Okay thanks” Hector said to the man. He dialed that number to check if that number actually belongs to Adam or not. “Hello! I am officer Hector Ross from the Boston police department. Am I talking to Adam Walter”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1272" data-line-end="1273">“You are talking to the right person. What do you want?” He replied with an inaudible laugh.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1274" data-line-end="1275">“I need to ask you a question Mr.Adam”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1276" data-line-end="1279">“Yes of course. I love questions”.<br>
        .<br>
        “Okay! So tell me the guy who died that day, Kevin Anderson. The guy in the news”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1280" data-line-end="1281">“Yes officer Hector I know that. What do you want to know from me about Kevin” Adam asked politely.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1282" data-line-end="1283">“I just want to ask, what do you think about Kevin Anderson? Is he the real KARAM, or is KARAM still out there in Boston?”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1284" data-line-end="1285">“If you believed what Olima said in the video, yes KARAM is still out there somewhere, and if you believe that you shot him dead then yes, KARAM is dead” Adam took a breath, “He being dead or alive is not the matter, you have to protect the girls, until it is proved that KARAM is actually dead… One last thing officer”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1286" data-line-end="1287">“Yes what?” Officer Hector stood up, he got curious.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1288" data-line-end="1289">“KARAM died with the Karia’s suicide”. After this officer Hector said, “what are you talking about”, but Adam had canceled the call right away, and now his phone is not reachable when Hector dialed his number again.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1290" data-line-end="1291">After the call with hector, Adam went to the flash back, to the time when the Kevin incident had happened.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1292" data-line-end="1293">April 8, 2019, Monday morning.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1294" data-line-end="1295">Adam decided to build his trust on the girls. He hired the kidnapper from the dark web. He gave some instructions to the kidnapper. How should he be dressed? What will be the location? What will be the time? And who would he kidnap.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1296" data-line-end="1297">The same day of planning and hiring the kidnapper. Adam calls all the girls to be at the Earl of Sandwich in the park at 5:30 PM. There they will discuss the security measure to be safe from KARAM, and will find a way to catch him.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1298" data-line-end="1299">It was a dark night that day, and soon it would be darker. Adam saw a man spying on them near the tennis court, he was dressed exactly the same as KARAM. Adam waited and waited for the right moment, making Edon drink more and more so she would go to the restroom. His plan worked.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1300" data-line-end="1301">Around 5:50 PM Edon decided to go to use the restroom. The same time Adam walked away for a private call. He took out an old sony ericsson flip phone and called officer Hector on his cell phone.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1302" data-line-end="1303">The man walks slowly towards Edon, as he was supposed to do. He tries to chloroform her. He failed. A sound was heard by both of them, “Don’t move. You are under arrest” officer Hector shouts, with his gun pointed towards him. The Kidnapper ran towards the Parkman, Bandstand. It’s easier for him to hide somewhere in the dark. The rain had started, and it was making the ground look like a lake, which created difficulty for him to run. As he reached closer to the bandstand, officer Hector shouted,”Stop it, or I’ll shoot”. Rain is also creating difficulty for him to listen to the clear sound of what the officer Hector was saying.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1304" data-line-end="1305">Officer had shot the bullet, and it hit the kidnapper in the middle of the skull from the back. He fell down on his face, motionless, and the blood was getting washed away in the rain.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1306" data-line-end="1308">The group of girls standing a few meters away from the dead body, holding hands and standing close to each other. Edon was getting curious and she went closer to the body. “Your game is over” She whispered. She tried to check his identity, but officer Hector said ”don’t touch the body”. “I just want to see his face and ID card,” Edon asked Politely.<br>
        Officer turned the body over and took out his wallet to show the ID to the girl, “Kevin Anderson” Edon read aloud his name.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1309" data-line-end="1311">The Police Department part 3<br>
        “Did you find out who Adam is?” Hannah asked as she saw Hector wandering outside on the bench of the police department.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1312" data-line-end="1313">“He is Adam Walter… We have to meet him in person. I think he knew something about KARAM. You go and get the address of this number” Hector ordered her, giving her his phone.</p>
        <hr>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1316" data-line-end="1317">They reached the location of the number. It was an old rusty apartment with the name Adam W Walter, engraved in the wall. Hannah rang the doorbell. An old man came out from inside, coughing.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1318" data-line-end="1319">“Hello sir. Is this Adam Walter’s house? Is he here?” Hannah asked politely.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1320" data-line-end="1321">“There is no Adam here, he died twenty years ago in a car accident” The man replied, closing the door on their face.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1322" data-line-end="1323">“If he died twenty years ago, who did I talk to?” Hector said to himself.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1324" data-line-end="1325">“It must be a phone number cloning. You have been talking to KARAM” Hannah said, shocked.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1326" data-line-end="1327">“He played with us again” Hector felt the shock.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1328" data-line-end="1330">Back on their way to the police department, Hector gave Hannah orders to search for Adam Walter, but without telling anyone about this incident. If they tell anyone about this, it would make people question their ability to solve any case.<br>
        After the breaking news of Olima’s videos against KARAM being back, the Massachusetts government decided to provide the safety to all seven of them. Each girl is provided with an individual female guard who will be with them twenty four seven. These guards were the information providers for the police, more than guarding the body.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1331" data-line-end="1332">There is a private company FPG, which provides protection for females all around the United States of America. FPG is a Female Protection group, and it provides seven female guards to these girls.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1333" data-line-end="1334">Matilda Harris will be guarded by Charlotte. Libby Butler will be guarded by Monica. Edon Matthew will be guarded by Julia. Mary Raymond will be guarded by Olivia. Josephine Edler will be guarded by Alice. Pamela Smith will be guarded by Jessica. Olima Gerald will be guarded by Venta.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1335" data-line-end="1336">Actually these guards don’t have full names, and even their first names were fake for the purpose of hiding their personal information.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1337" data-line-end="1338">Now the girls cannot go anywhere without their guards. They cannot meet anyone without the person being checked, unless the person is a parent or a sibling by blood, and some more weird rules. These rules were meant to be for their safety. Only Libby and Mary have their issues, they don’t want a shadow to be with them all the time.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1339" data-line-end="1340">Whenever the task is given to them, they are forced to do it. Everytime the guards stop them from doing the task, the girls simply hold hands with their guards, and they both get shocked. The next time guards only watch them doing the weird task thing, and just give the information of their action to the police.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1341" data-line-end="1342">The guards and the girls became friends after spending some time together.  Olima and Venta were like sisters to each other, they shared secrets with each other, they talked all the time. Mary and Libby are not friendly at all. They hate their guards and try to avoid them whenever possible. They never speak to them, except for replying to their weird questions.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1343" data-line-end="1344">Confusion, Irritation and anger. There is a lot of stuff going on inside KARAM’s head. He can’t understand why Maedrian was not picking up the calls, and why she is not answering the text messages. Something is strange, but what? It was in this conflict that the fire was raging for him.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1345" data-line-end="1346">There is only one thing he can think off now. He decided to give Maedrian a surprise visit, and he did. Later that day he knocked on her door and as he thought, Maedrain opened it.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1347" data-line-end="1348">“Hello sir. Come inside… What made you come to my home?” She asked, smiling. She is wearing the kitchen apron, covered in corn flour.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1349" data-line-end="1350">“Come here” KARAM dragged her to the corner, “This ring matter is getting out of hand… Why are the rings still working?”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1351" data-line-end="1352">“I’ve checked sir. There is nothing wrong with the configuration of the rings”</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1353" data-line-end="1354">“So… What’s happening? Who is controlling them?”</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1355" data-line-end="1356">“No sir. There is no one…” Maedrian paused, “I saw Olima’s video. She was lying. It must be a trick of her to get you out in public”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1357" data-line-end="1358">“How can that be possible? They all saw me die. I mean Kevin Anderson”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1359" data-line-end="1360">“It must be a public stunt then. You should become Adam and ask her yourself. I know you will find something useful…. And please don’t go back home. I am making cake. You should try it” Maedrian walked towards the kitchen.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1361" data-line-end="1364">Becoming Adam again looks good to KARAM. Now this is the only thing he thinks he can do to confirm what Olima said in her video.<br>
        “Okay. I like your idea. I will wait for a few days and we will see if there is anything important to discover about this whole mess… Thank you Maedrian. Have a nice day” KARAM said, giving her a kiss on the cheek. He walked away from there with confusing thoughts running through his mind.<br>
        He want to end this mess as soon as possible.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1365" data-line-end="1366">“I need to find him.” Olima said to Venta, who was watching outside the window.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1367" data-line-end="1368">“Find him… Who?” Venta asked in curiosity.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1369" data-line-end="1370">“KARAM. We… I mean, we girls don’t have his face, but we can find Saphira’s information, and from there we might find some clue, related to real KARAM” Olima told her the whole story.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1371" data-line-end="1374">“I don’t allow you to get yourself in danger. I am here to protect you” Venta ordered her, like a big sister.<br>
        .<br>
        “Please, Please…. And I am not doing this all by myself. You will be with me, all the time, and other girls and their guards will be with us” Olima said, with a pleased face.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1375" data-line-end="1376">“Okay. But you have to tell me each and everything you guys are going to do” Venta gave her order.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1377" data-line-end="1378">“Okay Boss” Olima hugged her. They both giggled.</p>
        <hr>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1381" data-line-end="1382">“Can you track, or get information about Saphira? Or do you know someone who can do this?” Pamela got a text message from Olima.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1383" data-line-end="1384">“What do you want to do with that? What is your plan?” Pamela replied, confused.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1385" data-line-end="1386">“Come to my home right now. I will tell you the whole scene” Olima replied with a smiley face emoji.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1387" data-line-end="1388">Around 6 PM in the evening, Pamela, Jessica, Olima and Venta were sitting in the living room of Olima’s apartment, listening to Olima’s plan carefully. According to Olima, her plan was foolproof and perfect.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1389" data-line-end="1390">“Listen carefully. If we can find Saphira’s data somehow, then from there we can find a way to reach the real KARAM, not Kevin Anderson” Olima said, smiling.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1391" data-line-end="1392">Olima’s mind, without any proof confirms that Kevin and KARAM are two different human’s. Now the only purpose of her life was to find him and ask him why he was not leaving them? Why is he not getting peace even with the death of Karia?</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1393" data-line-end="1394">“I can do that. I know her best friend Maddie. She can help us. I will ask her online” Pamela agreed with Olima’s plan.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1395" data-line-end="1396">Olima took out her phone, “Give me her email” She asked Pamela.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1397" data-line-end="1398">“Cool down girl, let me find it” Pamela searched Maddie’s email, and around thirty five minutes of searching they finally found the email and Olima started typing the email.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1399" data-line-end="1400">To: <a href="mailto:missmaddie779@mail.com">missmaddie779@mail.com</a></p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1401" data-line-end="1402">Hey!</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1403" data-line-end="1404">I am Olima Gerald from Boston Westview college. You don’t know me, and believe me you don’t want to know me either. I really need your help.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1405" data-line-end="1406">Saphira… I don’t know the surname. She was your best friend. I want to ask you only one thing. Do you know something about her that can help us find her? I have something that belongs to her.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1407" data-line-end="1408">Please reply.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1409" data-line-end="1411">Take care<br>
        Olima</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1413" data-line-end="1422">He had a keen eye on every move of these girls. She listened to every word Olima said, and she did not want them to execute whatever was going on in their mind. There is something fishy going on, she wanted to keep these girls away from Saphira.<br>
        If they got information about Saphira, they could somehow find and catch the real KARAM. The problem was not that they could find the real KARAM, even if they were able to find him, it wouldn’t stop her from her evil plans.<br>
        There was something going on, which is even hidden from herself at the moment.<br>
        For now, there were guards twenty four seven with these girls and because of this the fake KARAM is getting furious. She can’t execute her evil plan, and now if they got information about Saphira and that information goes public, it would create chaos for her.<br>
        She decided to somehow increase the shock power of the rings, she can’t, it is set at a particular range. She stood up and walked outside in the streets of Boston to get some fresh air, and to find a new idea for her evil plan.<br>
        Sitting on a bench inside a park, she thinks for a moment. “I know what they are saying. I know where they were all the time, so… so I should make them go to a place where they were away from their guards for some time…. And within that time I will do something with them” She spoke to herself.<br>
        She made a nice plan, but not every nice plan is executable. She knows the plan but doesn’t know what to do with it, it is just like a brilliant novel idea which is never written down. She wanted to use the rings to get rid of the guards, but she knew it wouldn’t be an easy task.<br>
        The problem was how to execute the plan? She needed help from someone who has a high level of intelligence, a person with a mind and power like KARAM. She had mind, and now she needs power.<br>
        After the morning shower Maedrian opened her laptop to check her emails. While surfing through emails she thought of checking the database of rings. If rings are still working, there must be some updates in the database.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1423" data-line-end="1424">She opened the database to check the record. She was shocked when she opened it. The last active record was three days before Karia’s suicide. KARAM had deactivated the rings from the remote, and now there was only one way to activate the rings.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1425" data-line-end="1426">The only way to activate the rings is possible if it is done by the system from which the rings are connected, “If I didn’t do it, so… who did it?” Maedrian thought.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1427" data-line-end="1428">Some strange thoughts were running through her mind, everything is weird for her at this moment. After a while, she calls KARAM, “Sir, can you meet me at home? I have an important thing to say to you”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1429" data-line-end="1430">“What is so important that you remembered at this moment?” KARAM asked, anxious.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1431" data-line-end="1432">“I can’t tell you on the phone, you have to come to my house right now. It is so important” Maedrian said in a hurry.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1433" data-line-end="1434">“Okay, Okay. Calm down, don’t worry. I am going to be at your house soon” KARAM canceled the call.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1435" data-line-end="1436">KARAM opened the window and looked outside, towards the direction of Maedrians house. “What is so important? The only possible thing is that she might have found something related to the fake KARAM. What else it could be?” he thought.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1437" data-line-end="1438">When KARAM arrived at Maedrian’s home, he rang the doorbell many times but no one opened the door, “Come on, Maedrian, please open the door”. He decided to go back, but as move one step towards the road, Maedrian opened the door from behind, “Come inside sir… and sorry I was in the bathroom”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1439" data-line-end="1440">Inside the living room Maedrian put the laptop in front of KARAM, to show him the ring’s activity. “See this sir”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1441" data-line-end="1442">“What?” He asked, curious.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1443" data-line-end="1444">“If the rings are still active, as Olima said in her video. There must be something changed in the database, but nothing has changed. The last active date is when you deactivate the rings from the remote” Maedrian said all this in a single breath.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1445" data-line-end="1446">“You said that Olima must have been lying,” KARAM questioned.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1447" data-line-end="1448">“Yaa I know. I’ve checked. I have tapped their phones. There is definitely someone giving them commands”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1449" data-line-end="1450">“You should trace where the commands are coming from?”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1451" data-line-end="1452">“No sir. I made the system so I know the location of the commands are not traceable… and one thing sir. Whoever this fake KARAM is, He or She gonna kill these girls”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1453" data-line-end="1454">“How can you say that?”</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1455" data-line-end="1456">“See this sir. The first command that fake KARAM said was, OBEY ME OR ELSE YOU WILL BE KILLED”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1458" data-line-end="1459">The next day morning after Olima’s email to Maddie. She got a reply back from her.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1460" data-line-end="1461">Hello!</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1462" data-line-end="1463">I am Maddie Summers. It is really nice of you to ask me for your help, and I am really happy for you.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1464" data-line-end="1465">You are asking me about my best friend Saphira K Andrew. I can’t tell you the whole detailed stuff about her, there is not much cheezy about her to tell you, she is a simple girl. She was an open book, a nerdy innocent girl.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1466" data-line-end="1467">In college Saphira was married to a guy named Keith Andrew. Before her marriage and some time after her marriage Saphira got depressed about something. She started getting panic attacks. She never told me why these attacks happened?</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1468" data-line-end="1469">Months before her suicide she was going to a private psychiatist in Boston. I don’t know the name of that clinic.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1470" data-line-end="1471">The rest is a mystery. Thank you.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1472" data-line-end="1473">Peace</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1474" data-line-end="1475">MissMaddie</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1476" data-line-end="1477">“Saphira K, and Keith. Now who is this Keith person” Olima was shocked looking at the names. She passes the phone to Venta to read the email.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1478" data-line-end="1479">&quot;Private psychiatrist… In Boston. How can someone get that depressed? ‘’ Venta whispered, “I think I know where this clinic is… There is only one private psychiatric clinic in Boston. My aunt runs it”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1480" data-line-end="1481">“We might find something about KARAM there. Let’s go. Hurry” Olima and Venta run towards the clinic. They messaged others to be there.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1482" data-line-end="1483">“Okat let’s go” Venta tapped Olima’s shoulder.</p>
        <hr>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1486" data-line-end="1487">Around 7:30 PM, they both reached the clinic and started asking some questions. The receptionist knew Venta so she didn’t hesitate to give them the records of the patients. They wanted to find a little clue related to KARAM.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1488" data-line-end="1489">Olima got her hands on Saphira K Andrews, and under the husband section there was a long name, Keith Andrew Revera Antonio Martine. “Keith is the actual KARAM. He planted Kevin, so everyone would think he died” Olima was shocked to see the name.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1490" data-line-end="1491">“Do you have any clue about who this Keith Andrew is?” Venta asked the receptionist.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1492" data-line-end="1493">“Yes. In the news when Kevin Anderson died, there was a person standing next to officer Hector. That man is Keith.” She replied.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1494" data-line-end="1495">“That man was Adam…” Olima thought, but didn’t say a word, she paused for a moment, “So for all this time Adam was with us”. After a long series of thoughts Olima said, “Let’s go back home Venta”…</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1496" data-line-end="1497">She walked towards the balcony of an under construction hotel in Boston, she took out a 7.62×51mm M24 sniper rifle and pointed it towards the psychiatric clinic. She started searching for Olima through the scope of the refile.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1498" data-line-end="1499">She waited and waited for a long time. She knew that Olima would be here at this time. It was obvious that she was following her for a long time, and now Olima would be no more to be followed. Just a few more minutes, and the crime would happen once more in Boston.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1500" data-line-end="1501">Olima and Venta walked out of the clinic and now they both were in the range of the scope, but Venta was not the target of fake KARAM, she only wanted to shoot Olima.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1502" data-line-end="1503">Olima was walking happily because she found a clue that would lead her to KARAM. Soon she got to the center of the plus sign of the scope. Now it was just the click of the trigger. She pointed the plus sign on Olima’s forehead and pressed the trigger.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1504" data-line-end="1505">Boom. It was a headshot. Olima fell down, motionless right in front of Venta, and she couldn’t do anything.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1506" data-line-end="1507">The fake KARAM laughed and she ran away safely right after she executed her evil plan.  She had done exactly what she wanted to do.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1508" data-line-end="1509">Venta looked back at Olima’s body lying on the footpath. She was shocked, anyone could have been shocked seeing a person dying right in front of them. For Venta, she just lost a sister.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1510" data-line-end="1511">“KARAM will never escape from me. I’ll hunt you till the end” screamed Venta as she put Olima’s head in her lap.</p>
        <hr>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1514" data-line-end="1515">It was late at night when the police arrived at the scene. They saw Venta holding the dead body of Olima in her arm while sitting on the road next to the psychiatric clinic. There was a bullet stuck in Olima’s head.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1516" data-line-end="1517">Police officers surrounded the area and started their investigation. They asked Venta all about the murder. “What happened?” asked one of the police officers.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1518" data-line-end="1519">“It is KARAM who did this. The bullet came from that way” Venta pointed towards the under construction building.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1520" data-line-end="1521">After some time, one of the police officers said, “We are going inside the under construction hotel.” They went up to the fourth floor and there the police found a bullet shell. It was a 7.62×51mm bullet shell.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1522" data-line-end="1524">For fake KARAM, taking her life is fun, but for Venta it is a sad moment, she lost her sister and her best friend.<br>
        Olima was dead, her body was taken to the mortuary. The police requested the family for the postmortem, but the family straight away disagreed. Venta on the other hand keeps on insisting the family agree for at least the ballistic report. Olima’s.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1525" data-line-end="1526">The very next day was the funeral of Olima Gerald. Her friends, family and lots of her youtube fans came to her funeral. Olima being an internet celebrity got a lot of coverage from the media.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1527" data-line-end="1528">All of her friends and their guards were interviewed by the media. There is one thing common in all the interviews, everyone said, “KARAM did this all. He killed her”. The real KARAM secretly attended the funeral as Adam. He also gave the interview, and he said that “KARAM did this”, only he knew which KARAM he was talking about.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1529" data-line-end="1530">Till this day the girls didn’t know that all this time Adam was helping them find KARAM, simply means that he was helping them find himself, or we can say that all this time he was diverting them to find himself.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1531" data-line-end="1532">Standing next to the coffin Venta was thinking of the incident last evening, she can still see and feel the blood stains on her hands. “Why?.. why I failed to save her… Why did we go there?” Venta started feeling like a loser. Now the other girl’s families thought that having guards was useless. They can’t protect the girls.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1533" data-line-end="1534">There is no other move that the family can take, so they decided to move out of the city. They thought that this place was no longer safe from them. First it took Karia’s life, and now Olima’s.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1535" data-line-end="1536">KARAM had become the pro level criminal of Boston, Massachusetts. KARAM did not want this to happen, he did not know how to stop this. He, at this moment, can’t think of anything to do. The only thing he thought of was to protect the girls by himself.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1537" data-line-end="1538">There would be two things.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1539" data-line-end="1540">If the family stays then the fake KARAM’s evil acts will still go on, still creating chaos.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1541" data-line-end="1543">If the family goes out of the city, they won’t be safe because he knows that if he can go out of Boston to make the girls wear the rings, the fake KARAM can do it too.<br>
        Adam contacted Maedrian to be at her apartment. He contacted all the girls from the private number, “I am someone who can tell you the truth about KARAM, and I can help you get rid of the rings on your finger. Follow the link, get to the location as soon as possible”. He knew that everyone wants to get rid of the rings, so they will definitely come to his apartment. He wants to help them.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1544" data-line-end="1545">A few moments later, they all meet up at Adam’s apartment. “You said that you can tell us who is KARAM?” Everyone asked. “Let’s say, for a moment, that I am KARAM…” Adam said, walking back and forth.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1546" data-line-end="1547">“You can’t be KARAM. You are so nice” Mary said.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1548" data-line-end="1549">“Me! being nice makes you think that I can’t be KARAM?” Adam questioned.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1550" data-line-end="1551">“When he talks face to face with us he always says Hello little ladies” Edon said.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1552" data-line-end="1553">KARAM did everything they say the actual KARAM did to make them believe that he is KARAM. “Believe me guys. I am the actual KARAM, and I did not kill Olima or Karia. There is someone pretending to be me, and that fake me was doing all this”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1554" data-line-end="1555">“Why do we believe you?” Josephine said.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1556" data-line-end="1557">“If I need to hurt you guys. Why would I tell you everything? Believe me, you are safe with me” KARAM replied.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1558" data-line-end="1559">“Wait… If KARAM. I mean Keith didn’t kill Olima, so who?” Edon stood up, pacing back and forth, “…Keith had a motive because he is Saphira’s husband… so if someone else is doing this shit, he must be related to Saphira for sure…”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1560" data-line-end="1561">“Why He? That person could be she” Maedrian said, sitting at the edge of the room with her laptop, trying to stop the rings from working.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1562" data-line-end="1563">“…Because girls are not that evil,” Edon replied. Keith gave her a serious look.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1564" data-line-end="1565">“Yes…” Maedrian shouted.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1566" data-line-end="1567">“What happened?” Everyone asked.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1568" data-line-end="1569">“The rings would not work anymore… But” Maedrian paused, biting her nails.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1570" data-line-end="1571">“But…What? Tell us please” All the girls asked.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1572" data-line-end="1574">“…It would be painful to take those rings off. And if you keep them on it might start working again”.<br>
        “I don’t care for the pain. I am just gonna cut it off” Josephine said.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1575" data-line-end="1576">“Are you gonna cut your finger off?” Pamela asked, with a serious look on her face.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1577" data-line-end="1578">“Are you stupid. Why would I cut my finger” Josephine replied.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1579" data-line-end="1580">“Okay… do you have anything to cut these rings” Pamela said to Keith</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1581" data-line-end="1582">“I’ll help you guys take those off, but please don’t scream” Maedrian said, squinting.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1583" data-line-end="1585">As soon as all the rings were off, with few screams, there was a knock at the door. “Boston police… Open up”.<br>
        On the day of Olima’s funeral, the whole area was covered with the news reporters. Everyone thought it was for Olima, but no. The news reporters came to her funeral to get the news about KARAM, they don’t care if anyone is dead or not.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1586" data-line-end="1587">All the girls said the same thing that KARAM killed her, even though they were not there at that moment, and didn’t see him shooting but they all were so confident about their statement.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1588" data-line-end="1589">Adam took a risk that day. He gave an interview to the reporter, “It is obvious that know one saw KARAM killing Olima, but who else would do that. No one else other than KARAM has a motive to kill the girl…or, does anyone else have the motive? Now it is up to the police to find out who was actually behind this murder. Thank you so much”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1590" data-line-end="1591">From the Boston police department. Officer Hector is watching the live news and on the tv he sees Adam. Hector ran towards the cyber department and ordered them to make the public know that Adam is not what they thought.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1592" data-line-end="1593">“Make that face go viral on the news. We need to find Adam. He is the criminal” Hector shouted.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1594" data-line-end="1595">There was a prize money of $100,000, whoever finds or helps the police to find Adam Walter. The only reason that was mentioned on the news for finding Adam was that he is the most wanted criminal. The police didn’t say that he is KARAM, or he is supposed to be KARAM because they weren’t sure.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1596" data-line-end="1597">Keith didn’t know that he went viral on the news. He was doing his work without being aware that everyone was on the bounty hunt for him. He and Maedrian didn’t know anything because they were too busy in finding the solution for saving the girls.</p>
        <hr>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1600" data-line-end="1601">Next day evening, an unknown number gave a tip to the police that he saw Adam. The unknown number didn’t tell his name at that moment for privacy concerns, he gave the location of the building where he saw Adam going. The unknown caller followed Adam to his apartment.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1602" data-line-end="1603">What else could happen? There was a knock at the door, “Boston police, open up”. The police entered the apartment and handcuffed both Keith and Maedrian.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1604" data-line-end="1606">“They didn’t do anything. They helped us. The real criminal is somewhere else” Girls shouted. All of them said that they are innocent but the police didn’t listen to a single word.<br>
        Boston police handcuffed and put Keith and Maedrian into the police car. They both were taken to the police station like they both were man reading monsters. Keith was thrown to the chair in the interrogation room with Lisa and Hector. Maedrian was taken somewhere else.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1607" data-line-end="1608">“Hey, Adam, or should I call you KARAM” Lisa said. Keith was in shock seeing both of them, he didn’t say a word.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1609" data-line-end="1610">Surprise, surprise. You must have been wondering how we caught you… It would be a mystery for you, because you like mysteries, right?</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1611" data-line-end="1612">“Surprise, surprise. You must have been wondering how we caught you… It would be a mystery for you, because you like mysteries, right?” Lisa slapped him on the face. “Your other buddies will be captured soon… For now we have you and that bitch of yours…”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1613" data-line-end="1614">“You want me… You got me. Leave her alone. She didn’t do anything” Keith said in a serious tone.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1615" data-line-end="1616">“Somebody got killed a few days back. You and everyone related to you are involved in this” Officer Hector said, moving close to him.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1617" data-line-end="1618">Lisa tried to say something but paused, giving Keith a look.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1619" data-line-end="1620">“Even if she’s not the bad guy… She is involved with you, and she is a criminal too. Just like you” Hector said, sitting on the next chair to him.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1621" data-line-end="1622">“She, and even I am not involved in any sort of murder. I know I did some bad stuff, but I am not a killer” Karam said, staring at Hector.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1623" data-line-end="1624">“Somebody’s gotta get charged for that murder.” Lisa said, curled lips.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1625" data-line-end="1626">“So… You can charge me with anything you want. I used that girl as my pawn, she didn’t do anything wrong.” KARAM said with an innocent face.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1627" data-line-end="1628">“We’re gonna prove that you both are involved in the murder of Karia William and Olima Gerald” Hector said.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1629" data-line-end="1630">“You give us the names of your other buddies, and we might think of losing her free…” Lisa was about to complete the sentence but soon she saw gas entering the room. All three fainted right away.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1631" data-line-end="1632">Someone attacked the police department with the smoke bombs. The whole department was covered in smoke, and everyone was down. A girl dressed like KARAM entered the smoke with a gas mask on. She tied and dragged Keith and Maedrian outside and threw them in the van.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1633" data-line-end="1634">Keith and Maedrian were rolling at the back of the van. As soon as the engine of the van roared, there was a black jeep at the corner of the police department, like someone was trying to follow them.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1635" data-line-end="1636">The van took them to an rusty old abandoned warehouse in Boston. In the middle of the police department and warehouse, Keith and Maedrian woke up, still rolling at the back of the van.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1637" data-line-end="1638">There was a room in the corner of the warehouse. Fake KARAM took them both out of the van and took them to the room at gunpoint. She tied them both to the chair, and took a deep breath. She took off her mask. Keith recognized her but couldn’t say a word.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1639" data-line-end="1640">“Martha. You?” Keth said, stammering. He recognized that the fake KARAM was Martha, Saphira’s younger sister.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1641" data-line-end="1642">“I know what you’re gonna say. Calm down bro, I will tell you everything” Martha replied. She moved towards the other chair, where Maedrian was tied.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1643" data-line-end="1644">“Hey. You… Bitch. I know what you did with those rings, and now you’re gonna make those shock rings again, much stronger than before”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1645" data-line-end="1646">“You think I am stupid? I don’t want to make anyone’s life a hell again. I will never make those rings again… and if I or anyone else makes those rings, I will make sure that those girls won’t put them on.” Maedrian disagreed right away.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1647" data-line-end="1648">“Oh! really?” Martha slapped her so hard that she fell down on the floor, still tied to the chair.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1649" data-line-end="1651">“Can you please stop this, and tell me why you are doing this. Why do you want to kill them? I’ve already done so much with them. Please stop this” Keith said, looking into her eyes.<br>
        “Listen. You are playing with these girls because of Saphira, obviously. I have the same reason. It is tit for tat. They killed my sister, and now I am going to kill them all” Martha said, moving closer to him.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1652" data-line-end="1653">“I’ve already taught them the lesson. That’s enough. Please don’t kill other girls” Keith said.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1654" data-line-end="1655">“When I saw the news that Karia died. People were saying that KARAM killed her. I got the idea of becoming KARAM. I know you Keith Andrew. It wasn’t hard for me to guess that KARAM is your initials”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1656" data-line-end="1657">“How did you get into my laptop?” Maedrian said, still on the floor, trying to get up. Martha gets close to her and helps get her up.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1658" data-line-end="1659">“Oh! That. I saw the video of Karia, and I know about the rings system. I’ve hired a hacker to hack Keith, and from there I found you. I stalked you for a month then I told the hacker to clone your laptop in the same looking laptop as yours… One day when you were going on a trip, I entered your apartment and replaced your laptop with a fake one… You guys played with others, and I played with you”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1660" data-line-end="1662">Boom. Someone entered the warehouse. “How? Nobody knows this play. How can someone come here?” Martha pointed the gun towards the door.<br>
        Sitting in a black jeep outside the Boston police department, she was waiting for KARAM. She had seen in the news that Adam is KARAM, and since then she had been waiting for him in the jeep, outside the police department, to see if she could find a chance to shoot him.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1663" data-line-end="1664">After a while, everything that happened there was beyond her imagination.  A girl dressed like KARAM entered the smoke with a gas mask on. “What the hell is happening” Venta got confused.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1665" data-line-end="1666">Around ten to fifteen minutes later the female version of KARAM dragged Adam and a girl (who is unknown to Venta) and threw them into the van. Venta had seen the whole smoke bomb attack on police departmen.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1667" data-line-end="1668">The only thing on his mind was the misunderstanding in the hearts of the girl’s families that they could not save their daughters. She should get rid of this misunderstanding. The other thing was that she wanted to avenge Olima’s death from Salman, she had sworn.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1669" data-line-end="1670">She does not have any other option instead of following the van. From about seven to eight feets away from the van, she followed until it stopped at the old abandoned warehouse. Venta waited outside for a long time. She needs to make a plan before she enters the warehouse.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1671" data-line-end="1672">Around forty five minutes of waiting, Venta entered the warehouse where she saw a room at the corner. Boom, she started firing bullets at the door.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1673" data-line-end="1674">The door opens by itself and Venta sees Adam and Maedrian tied on the chair. Without any second thought she shot Adam, It was a headshot, like fake KARAM did with Olima. Venta then shot Martha in the leg.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1675" data-line-end="1676">“I am sending you the location. Someone killed KARAM” Venta texted the police department, threw her phone on the ground, and walked outside. She felt relieved.</p>
        <hr>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1679" data-line-end="1681">Police arrived at the location. They saw Martha on the floor, bleeding leg, motionless and Maedrian crying. Keith’s body was taken for the postmortem, and Martha and Maedrian was charged with the murder of Keith Andrew.<br>
        There was news all over Boston that the real KARAM is Keith Andrew Ravera Antonio Martine, and he is dead now. KARAM or Keith or Adam died without being proved innocent, everyone still thinks he is the killer of Karia and Olima.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1682" data-line-end="1683">Everything seems to be over now. All the families packed up their luggage and started to drive far away from Boston, where there is no evil. Soon they reached the Zero KM Boston sign. Boom. Every single car exploded.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1684" data-line-end="1685">Martha had already attached the boom with the cars before she captured Maedian and Keith.</p>
        <hr>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1688" data-line-end="1690">Martha heard the news from inside the cell, she laughed. She had executed the plan that she wanted to.<br>
        Monday Morning.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1691" data-line-end="1692">KARAM is sitting on his couch, sipping his usual coffee, still thinking about what Karia did to herself. Soon he opened his laptop and scrolled down to find recent Boston news. On scrolling down he saw a video titled “He is back”. Olima uploaded it tomorrow. He did not want to open the video because now he was trying to end this KARAM game.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1693" data-line-end="1694">He couldn’t resist so he clicked the video.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1695" data-line-end="1696">“Hello guys! I don’t really know how to start this video, or what to say… This would be my first last video. Okay… I am gonna start with KARAM.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1697" data-line-end="1698">Not what he did with us, or the ring stuff. I am here to talk about what the news said, and what everyone thinks… In the news Kevin Anderson died and they said he is KARAM… The evil has ended… But.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1699" data-line-end="1700">Tomorrow When I woke up I saw a message on my phone… the same as KARAM used to send us when he wanted to give us some sort of task to complete…It said THE GAME IS NOT OVER YET, and after that my ring gave me an electric shock.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1701" data-line-end="1703">If he is dead… What news people say… So… Who is still operating these rings?<br>
        Believe me guys Kevin Anderson was not the actual KARAM. He is still out there somewhere and we still don’t know who he is.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1704" data-line-end="1705">Through this video. I ask the government to give us protection or somehow find the actual KARMA.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1706" data-line-end="1707">Thank you Guys to sticking around with me.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1708" data-line-end="1709">Bye”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1710" data-line-end="1711">“What the heck. Why are the rings still working?” He talked to himself. “This must be a lie. This must be some sort of a publicity stunt”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1712" data-line-end="1713">He started walking back and forth in his apartment. He walks in his room and picks his phone from the bed, and dialed Maedrian’s phone number. “The rings are still working? And who the hell is giving them commands. If this is true? This situation is going to create danger for me”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1714" data-line-end="1715">“I don’t know sir. I think someone hacked the software of the rings. I am on vacation with my family right now. I will recover the software as soon as possible. You just relax, no worries” Maedrian said, cutting the conversation.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1716" data-line-end="1717">Karam sat on his couch, still thinking about the video.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1718" data-line-end="1719">“Maybe it is a hoax. Maybe it is a plan to fool me. But if it is not, then what will I do? I need to get to the bottom of this, and figure out what she was up to?&quot;. After two hours of thinking, Karam finally decided to go outside for a walk and take some fresh air. He was not able to take any more pressure.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1720" data-line-end="1721">As he was walking through the streets, he saw a group of people standing in front of a small building. He could see a couple of policemen standing next to the building. He put his face down and walked silently towards the other side.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1722" data-line-end="1723">6:15AM.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1724" data-line-end="1725">“I never thought you would do this to yourself” KARAM talking to himself, standing at the place where Karia fell down given her life. The blood stains were still there. A plan for the taste of their own medicine went too far.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1726" data-line-end="1727">He never wanted anyone to take their own life, he just wanted to teach them a little lesson about how it feels when you bring someone to a situation that you left them with no chance, but to take their own life.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1728" data-line-end="1729">Little did he know that teaching them the lesson would become a nightmare for him.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1730" data-line-end="1731">KARAM heard a voice from behind, someone was walking slowly towards him. When he looked back it was Maedrian. “What are you doing here sir?” She asked.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1732" data-line-end="1733">“I don’t have any other choice but to be here. I can’t let her go like this. It’s my fault she took her life away, and if I keep this same thing happening, others gonna do the same thing” KARAM replied, looking at the blood stains, lost in his thoughts.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1734" data-line-end="1735">“Please don’t blame yourself for what happened to her, you had no idea she was going to do this, and it wasn’t your fault. Please sir, leave this place, we need to get out of this area before anyone sees us, and connect us with this suicide&quot; Maedrian replied, putting a hand on his shoulder.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1736" data-line-end="1737">Soon they both reached the apartment. Maedrian walked towards the kitchen, “I will make you some breakfast” She said, giving him a smile.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1738" data-line-end="1739">“Hey Maddie… Shutdown those rings. I want to free these girls” KARMA shouts from the living room.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1740" data-line-end="1742">“I will do it sir. I don’t have my laptop now…” Maedrian said, bringing toast and egg for him, “I might go now, it’s getting late” Maedrian said, looking at the wall clock. As she left the apartment she looked at him from behind, “Sorry sir” She whispered to herself.<br>
        After uploading the video, He is Back… Olima went outside her room for breakfast. As soon as she had her breakfast, she went to her room, picked up the phone and messaged the girls to meet up at the cafe to talk.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1743" data-line-end="1744">“Meet me at Ziggy’s Cafe… Now. We need to talk” Olima typed the message in a group chat. All six of them replied okay, but in their own style.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1745" data-line-end="1746">She walked into the cafe and was greeted by the girls.  They sat at a table as Olima sat down at the end of the table.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1747" data-line-end="1748">The girls immediately began to discuss the video Olima posted this morning. “We watched the video and we were really impressed by your guts, you are not looking even a little bit scared of him” Mary, Edon and Pamela said.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1749" data-line-end="1750">“Who do you think controls the rings? KARAM… I mean Kevin is dead now, right?” Matilda said, biting her lower lip.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1751" data-line-end="1752">“That’s what I am about to say. Listen carefully” Olima said.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1753" data-line-end="1754">“Yes…Yes…Yes…” Everyone said in unison.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1755" data-line-end="1756">“The question is that…is KARAM dead or alive. Because, if KARMA… aka Kevin Anderson died then who the hell is controlling the rings” Olima took a sip of juice.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1757" data-line-end="1758">“The rings could be on automatic setting??” Josephine said, confused.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1759" data-line-end="1760">Olima continued, “It can be the possibility. What I think is that he is still alive, somewhere around us in Boston, and Kevin must be one of his pawns… or”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1761" data-line-end="1762">“…Or one of his pawns are controlling the rings” Josiephine complete Olima’s sentence.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1763" data-line-end="1764">“Yup… This can be the possibility too. But still the question is the same. Is KARAM dead or alive” Olima is confused.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1765" data-line-end="1766">“If he is still alive, he is gonna ruin our lives…Again” Edon said, in a cocky manner.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1767" data-line-end="1768">“Who knows?” Everyone said in unison.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1769" data-line-end="1770">Whatever is happening to them is done by whom? Someone thinks it’s KARAM, and someone thinks it is someone related to KARAM.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1771" data-line-end="1772">At the same moment when they were discussing KARAM being dead or alive, they all got a task, “DON’T WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS. YOU ONLY HAVE TO FOLLOW MY ORDERS”. They all got electric shocks right after this message.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1773" data-line-end="1774">Now that they were done with the warehouse, they all had to make a decision. Either to live their lives in silence, or decide a way to end the chapter of Mr. K.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1775" data-line-end="1776">“We can’t run from this. We have to make a stop to this Mr.K chapter.” Maedrian suggested.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1777" data-line-end="1778">“But how?” everyone asked.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1779" data-line-end="1780">“I have an idea…” Michelle brings Karia’s laptop, “We know that Karia has a quite big following on her youtube channel. We all can make a video in which we can tell the whole story to the public. Tell them about Kristopher. We can leave the rest to the media.”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1781" data-line-end="1782">“It’s a really nice idea. Let’s do this.” Keith said.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1783" data-line-end="1784">They all sat down in the living room, sharing the whole thing that happened to that. They told the public to be aware of this Kristopher J Vian. And it all worked. About an hour later the video went viral. The media went to Kristopher’s office for some answers.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1785" data-line-end="1787">It is concluded that Kristopher ran away from Boston. He ran away, and some people assume that he is dead, and some people still thaught that it was a plan of KARAM.<br>
        The sun set behind the trees in Massachusetts.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1788" data-line-end="1789">A shadowy figure of a man dressed in all black slipped through the gates of Boston’s old cemetery, holding a bouquet of peonies. He moved stealthily through the cemetery, past old and damaged graves, his eyes fixed on the name etched into the headstone: Keith Martine.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1790" data-line-end="1791">He placed the bouquet on the grave and began to speak.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1792" data-line-end="1793">“You don’t deserve to be down here, resting in peace, or maybe in pain… But don’t worry, now I will take on your legacy.”</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1794" data-line-end="1795">He made his way around the grave, he ran his fingers over the rough stone surface, his nails scraping against the engravings. He seemed lost in thought as if he was communing with the spirit of the man buried beneath his feet.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1796" data-line-end="1797">The man’s voice was low and menacing he started to speak to himself. “You made a nice path for me to follow… I can’t be as evil as you were. I will be eviler.”</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1798" data-line-end="1799">As he was about to walk away from the grave, he stopped and continued, “Sorry… I haven’t introduced myself. I am K-Vian. We don’t know each other, we never met. I am a hacker, and I love to torture people like you. And one great thing is that I now live at your place in Boston. I haven’t removed your nameplate ‘Keith Martine’.” The man’s lips curled into a wicked smile as he looked down at the grave. &quot;I hope you’re enjoying your life after.” He laughed and walked away.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1800" data-line-end="1801">Two men, one in a black hoodie and the other in a lab coat, moved closer to the same grave. The one in a black hoodie picked up the bouquet that K-Vian had placed gently near the headstone of Keith’s grave.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1802" data-line-end="1803">“Peonies… It means healing when you put it on someone’s grave.” He said to the man in the lab coat. “K-Vian wants to create chaos again. He wants to terrorize the streets of Boston again.”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1804" data-line-end="1806">“From his words… I can predict that. He won’t stop just on the streets of Boston. He wanted to terrorize the whole of Massachusetts.” The man in the lab coat said with a sad look on his face.<br>
        It was about a week after everything had happened in Boston, Massachusetts.</p>

        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1825" data-line-end="1826">Inside the Boston City Hospital, all the bodies and the stuff with them were taken for examination. The bodies were taken to the ICU in the hope for them to be revived, but nothing worked as planned.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1827" data-line-end="1828">Mr. Smith her daughter June Smith, and Jade Williams stood outside the hallway looking in through the glass door. June and Jade saw their loved ones and everyone else motionless on the bed.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1829" data-line-end="1830">From the impact of the blast, the bodies were intact but their souls were taken away, they went to where they belonged.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1831" data-line-end="1832">“What happened, dad? why do they have to leave like like this?” June asked her dad, and tears started rushing out of her eyes.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1833" data-line-end="1834">“I don’t know … Some people have to pay for someone else’s deeds” Mr. Smith replied in a sad tone.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1835" data-line-end="1836">“I totally agree with you, sir.&quot; Jade agrees with Mr. Smith’s statement.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1837" data-line-end="1838">June and Jade stared at the TV screen in an office next to the ICU. There is a piece of breaking news going on about Mr.K’s threat video message. Mr. K had become a news sensation in Boston. Every single news channel is talking about him.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1839" data-line-end="1840">“Now, who the hell is this Mr.k?” Jade got confused.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1841" data-line-end="1842">“It must be KARAM with a new name and identity.” June is connecting her sister’s death and Mr. K with the ring scenario that happened in the hotel room in Orlando.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1843" data-line-end="1844">“ooh… that guy,” Jade whispered.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1845" data-line-end="1846">Not only June and Jade but the citizens of Boston nearly half of the population thought that Mr. K is KARAM. And from now they won’t stop connecting anything that happens from Mr. K’s threat message to further on with KARAM, Keith Martine.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1847" data-line-end="1849">A dead person is to be blamed from now on.<br>
        January 2020, Monday morning.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1850" data-line-end="1851">As the sun set on the bustling streets of Boston, well-known and highly respected lawyer, Kristopher J., made his way to the police department for a meeting with his newest client, Martha Kristina. The stakes were high for Kristopher, as Martha was facing charges for not one, not two, but three heinous crimes that had occurred in the city in recent weeks.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1852" data-line-end="1853">As he entered the dimly lit conference room, he saw Martha sitting across the table, face down with an evil smile. Kristopher heard her evil low tone laugh.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1854" data-line-end="1855">“I think you are unaware of what you are being charged with?” Kristopher said, sitting down in front of her.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1856" data-line-end="1857">“I know… I am being charged with Keith’s murder… his and his bitch’s kidnapping, and Olima’s Murder. Blah, Blah, Blah… That’s why I hired you. Get me out of this and your mouth will be stuffed with cash.” Martha is getting rude to Kristopher.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1858" data-line-end="1859">“… and also the blast” He added, “But don’t worry I will get you out of this. It is easy to prove the blast to be a terrorist attack.”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1860" data-line-end="1861">“What do you want to do now? Get me out of here.”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1862" data-line-end="1863">“I just want to know the truth. Who killed Keith… If you didn’t”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1864" data-line-end="1865">“It was that…” Martha tries hard to remember, “… that guard bitch. I don’t remember her name but I know someone who did…” Martha repeated the whole scenario of that day to Kristopher.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1866" data-line-end="1867">The meeting time was over, Martha was taken back to her cell and Kristopher went for his next meeting… with Maedrian Antonio.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1868" data-line-end="1869">Knock, Knock. Maedrian opened the door with a smile on her face. “Yes, Sir?” Maedrian asked as Kristopher stood outside her door wearing the old traditional lawyer’s uniform.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1870" data-line-end="1871">“So miss… tell me about the person who killed Keith Martine.” He asked straight away as he sat down on the couch in the living room.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1872" data-line-end="1873">“I can still hear those gunshots in my mind…” Maedrian started the melodrama but was interrupted by him.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1874" data-line-end="1875">“Miss… I know that day very well. I was just asking who was the person behind the killing.”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1876" data-line-end="1879">“Wait…” Maedrian stood up from the couch and walked toward her room. A moment later She came back with her laptop and put it in front of him with a biodata of Venta moon. “There you go. She is the one who did all this… And I mailed this information to your id already.”.<br>
        “That’s quick. Thanks” Kristopher stood up. Maedrian walked her outside.<br>
        Keith Andrew Ravera Antonio Martine, widely known as KARAM, was an accomplished individual in the field of botany.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1880" data-line-end="1881">He dedicated his life to the study of plants and their ecological impact. His tireless efforts paid off with several well-respected research labs in the United States.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1882" data-line-end="1883">He received his Ph.D. in Botany and used his education to further his knowledge and contribute to the field.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1884" data-line-end="1885">KARAM was a true expert in his field and his work continues to influence and inspire others in the botany community.</p>

        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1888" data-line-end="1889">Dr. Keith Andrew Ravera Antonio Martine, or KARAM, as he preferred to be known, was a man of many talents.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1890" data-line-end="1891">Despite earning a Ph.D. in Botany, he chose to go by his non-academic name. He didn’t want to give the impression of being overly scholarly or distant.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1892" data-line-end="1893">Instead, he wanted to connect with people on a personal level and share his passion for botany with others.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1894" data-line-end="1895">As a result, he took on the role of a personal tutor, teaching individuals about the science and beauty of plants.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1896" data-line-end="1897">He believed that botany was not just a subject to be studied, but a way to appreciate the natural world.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1898" data-line-end="1899">With his vast knowledge and enthusiasm for the subject. He made learning about botany an enjoyable and enlightening experience for those he taught.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1900" data-line-end="1901">Keith Andrew Ravera Antonio Martine, aka KARAM, found love and happiness with his wife Saphira.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1902" data-line-end="1903">He shared his passion for botany with her and taught her everything he knew about plants. Saphira proved to be a quick learner and soon became an expert in her own right.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1904" data-line-end="1905">Together, they transformed their home into a botanical garden, filled with a diverse range of plants and flowers.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1906" data-line-end="1907">They spent countless hours tending to their garden, observing the plants and marveling at the beauty of nature.</p>

        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1910" data-line-end="1911">They often talked about their favorite plants, shared tips, and spent time in their beautiful botanical garden.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1912" data-line-end="1913">Their love story was a testament to the power of shared interests and a shared love for nature.</p>

        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1916" data-line-end="1917">Keith always dropped her off at kindergarten and picked her up at the same time every day. They would also go to the park and enjoy their time together as any normal couple would.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1918" data-line-end="1919">Unfortunately, things took a drastic turn when Saphira took her own life. The loss devastated Keith and he never became the same person again.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1920" data-line-end="1921">The highly educated botanist underwent a significant transformation. He left his old life behind and become the mysterious and feared figure known as KARAM.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1922" data-line-end="1923">His transformation was not a gradual one, but a sudden and dramatic change that left the people of Boston in shock.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1924" data-line-end="1925">The once kind and gentle botanist, known for his love of nature and his passion for teaching others, had disappeared. In his place, there was a dark and ominous presence that the people of Boston came to fear and loathe.</p>

        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1928" data-line-end="1929">Some whispered that he had become a criminal, using his knowledge of plants for sinister purposes. Others speculated that he had gone mad and was now a danger to society.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1930" data-line-end="1931">Regardless of the reason.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1932" data-line-end="1933">KARAM’s transformation from a respected botanist to a mysterious and feared figure left a deep impression on the people of Boston.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1934" data-line-end="1936">His reputation as a dangerous and unpredictable person made him the subject of many rumors and tales, and he became a legend in the city.<br>
        In Boston, Massachusetts. The first flats building, opposite LIME st sign.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1937" data-line-end="1938">A girl from Italy, Crest Town, Michelle Edward Conley came to become a flatmate at Mr. Williams’s apartment which is now owned by Jade Williams, his daughter and the elder sister of Karia Williams, who gave up her life from the same flat.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1939" data-line-end="1940">Knock, Knock. Michelle knocked on the door twice, she saw a dark-haired young girl standing in front of her with a smile on her face.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1941" data-line-end="1942">“Hello… I am Michelle… I am here to live with you.” Michelle said the whole thing in breaks, “There was an ad in the newspaper that you need a flatmate. Here are all the documents needed.”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1943" data-line-end="1944">“Yeah… Come inside” Jade said, staring at the documents. “What is this… Michelle JWE Conley. What is JWE?”. Jade welcomed her inside.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1945" data-line-end="1946">“Oh that… I am Michelle Joseph William Edward Conley. You can call me just Michelle.”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1947" data-line-end="1948">“Wow. You have a pretty long name.” Jade got shocked. “Come with me. I will show you the room.”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1949" data-line-end="1950">Michelle followed her toward Karia’s room.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1951" data-line-end="1952">“This is the room. It’s my sister’s room.” Jade guided her.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1953" data-line-end="1954">“Where is she now?” Michelle asked as she was roaming inside the room.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1955" data-line-end="1956">“She is somewhere better than this world,” Jade said, lost in thoughts. She didn’t tell Michelle about the suicide.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1957" data-line-end="1958">“Oh… I am so sorry.” Michelle understood what Jade meant. She didn’t ask for details.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1959" data-line-end="1960">In the evening when everything was going as normal as always, Jade was browsing on her phone, and Michelle was doing her usual thing, math. They heard the news on the television that jade had left playing in the living room. The news is being played on every single channel. Michelle walked out of Karia’s room and Jade from hers. They both stared at the TV screen, there was a dead body found in Beacon Hill’s alley.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1961" data-line-end="1962">“What the hell is going on? Not here too.” Michelle recently got her mind straight after the murder of Natalie Moyer, and here she again saw another dead body.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1963" data-line-end="1964">“Mr. K did what he said he would do” Jade spoke.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1965" data-line-end="1966">“Wait… who is this Mr. K. What does K mean?” Michelle got super confused. She knew nothing about Mr. K’s threat video.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1967" data-line-end="1968">“People say he is KARAM… I think he is someone who wants people to think that he is him” Jade said like she doesn’t care.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1969" data-line-end="1970">“Now who is this KARAM?” Michelle got confused again.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1971" data-line-end="1973">“You won’t understand if I tell you. You can search for him on the Boston news website” Jade walked away.<br>
        Mr. K, the mystery man had started his murder journey. He was the man of his word. He did what he said he was going to do.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1974" data-line-end="1975">On a bright sunny day, the Boston police found a dead body of a young teen girl, wearing a cheerleader uniform, face down on the ground. The body was found in a rarely used alley near lime street, Beacon Hill, Boston. Her face was smashed against the ground, no weapon was used. The killer left nothing for her identification.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1976" data-line-end="1977">Police got the CCTV footage of a black man following the girl. The girl ran for her life but was captured by him. The killer brutally smashed her face against the ground several times. She resisted, but at that moment resistance didn’t work for her.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1978" data-line-end="1979">The crime scene CCTV footage is being checked in detail to find something, even a little clue that can lead to the man in the black jacket.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1980" data-line-end="1981">After many hours of careful observation and searching, the police found a broken cell phone at the edge of the street under the bush. This cellphone might be their first step towards the black jacket man.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1982" data-line-end="1983">With everything going against what had been planned, the cyber team had found a clue. They found a threatening message in the broken cell phone.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1984" data-line-end="1986">“Shut down your shit or I will shut you down.”.<br>
        His game did not end yet. After the first murder in Beacon Hill alley, and during the investigation, there’s another live news of a mass murder happening in a girl’s college.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1987" data-line-end="1988">“Tara… Where are you? Come outside, or everyone’s gonna die just because of you” A male voice echoed throughout the college.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1989" data-line-end="1990">The main target was Tara Tucker, the prom queen. She was the biggest bully in the college.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1991" data-line-end="1992">There were more than five men who entered the college. The one who is constantly calling Tara is their leader. The attack was thought to be a terrorist attack and is being blamed on Muslims, as always. Being a college attack, some people are connecting it with Mr. K and KARAM.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1993" data-line-end="1994">The only and definite reason for the mass murder is that the terrorists or the shooters inside the college only want Tara. The rest of the murders are done to scare everyone and to show the public their power.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1995" data-line-end="1996">As the situation started to slip out of hand inside the college, Tara Tucker was nowhere to be found in any of the classrooms, she had disappeared, or must be hiding somewhere.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1997" data-line-end="1998">From outside the college, someone threw a bag and a notebook which the police had found. There was a message “Help” written on the notebook cover it was a sign for the police to help them. The notebook belongs to Tara Tucker. She and her friend were hiding in the bathroom.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1999" data-line-end="2000">The police found a non-password-protected iPhone inside the bag that revealed Tara had been receiving threatening messages from someone named “K.”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2001" data-line-end="2002">The police were frantically searching for her, but their efforts were hindered by the gunmen who were still at large inside the college.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2003" data-line-end="2004">As the situation unfolded, it became clear that the attackers were not terrorists or religious extremists, but rather a group of hired individuals who were there to torture Tara Tucker for something she had done to someone. They had carefully planned and executed the attack to send a message to her and others like her that their actions would not go unpunished.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2005" data-line-end="2006">The investigation into the mass murder led the police to Mr. K and KARAM, two figures who were blamed to be involved in the previous murder in Beacon Hill Alley.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2007" data-line-end="2008">It was discovered that whoever is behind this wants the public to know what he is capable of doing.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2009" data-line-end="2010">As the search for Tara continued, it became clear that she was not the only target of the attackers. They had also targeted other students who they deemed to be bullies or who had wronged them in some way.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2011" data-line-end="2012">As the police were frantically searching for Tara Tucker and whoever is with her, they were found by the attackers hiding in a bathroom stall. The sound of their muffled whispers gave away their location, and before they knew it, the stall door was kicked open, and they were dragged out by their hair.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2013" data-line-end="2014">Tara and her friend were terrified as they were brought before the leader of the attackers. He sneered at them, revealing a twisted grin that sent shivers down their spines. It was clear that he had been waiting for this moment for a long time.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2015" data-line-end="2016">The man in the black jacket came closer to Tara and said, “Finally found you bitch”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2017" data-line-end="2019">They left the friend free and the man in the black jacket slammed Tara’s face on the floor, like the girl in the Alley.<br>
        The day after the college mass murder, inside the living room, Lime Street.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2020" data-line-end="2021">Michelle is reading a book and Jade is watching Netflix but suddenly the video switches to a man in a black jacket walking closer to the screen. It was another video message from Mr.K that appeared on billboards and news channels everywhere. In the video, Mr.K confidently took responsibility for all the recent murders, declaring himself as the man in the black jacket.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2022" data-line-end="2023">The memory of these recent murders and the image of Mr.K’s cold, unfeeling face in the video message would haunt the city for a long time to come. People were left to wait and hope for the best while trying to come to terms with the reality that a dangerous killer was on the loose.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2024" data-line-end="2025">The news of Mr.K taking responsibility for the mass murders in the city had spread like a wildfire. It was all anyone could talk about, and everyone was shocked and frightened by the idea that a single person could carry out such heinous acts, but the fact that this person was so confident and arrogant that he was willing to publicly take responsibility for them made it even more unsettling.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2026" data-line-end="2027">“What the hell is going on here?” Michelle asked Jade as the video ends. Jade said nothing just, “Umm” Mr.K’s heinous acts left her speechless.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2028" data-line-end="2029">“How can a person be that easy after killing someone” Michelle continues, she is confused.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2030" data-line-end="2031">“Don’t overload your mind with these useless things, these things keep going on here. It is a waste of time to think about all these.” Jade said to Michelle as she walked towards her room.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2032" data-line-end="2033">Michelle stood there, staring at the stats of the college mass murders and the murder before that. It was like something clicked in her mind. “He killed a lot of people in three days… If Mr.K is the black jacket man and he did these killings. According to my calculations, he must be somewhere here…” Michelle circled her finger on the Boston map she opened on her phone. She is talking to herself.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2034" data-line-end="2036">The location she calculated was the area where KARAM lived.<br>
        “Hey… Jade” Michelle shouted and walked towards Jade’s room. She shared her calculations with her so that she might know the killer’s location. “Can you please come with me?”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2037" data-line-end="2038">“Are you serious girl?.. Do you think it is that easy to find the killer” Jade got confused about what was going on inside Michelle’s head? But she agreed.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2039" data-line-end="2040">Both the girls reached the pointed location on Michelle’s phone. Their plan is to search the apartments nameplates and make a list of any person with a name starting with K. With bad luck they haven’t found a single house with a name starting with K. They are at their last apartment but they see two men walking towards it, so they waited.</p>
        <hr>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2042" data-line-end="2043">Keith and Jay walked towards Keith’s apartment to get the confirmation of K-Vian being inside there. Keith knocked on the door. A young guy in a suit opened the door.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2044" data-line-end="2045">“Yes…” He said.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2046" data-line-end="2047">“We want to meet Mr.K-Vian,” Keith asked politely.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2048" data-line-end="2049">“There is no K-Vian. I am Kristopher and bought this place.”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2050" data-line-end="2051">“Sorry. We were just friends. We might have entered the wrong building.” Jay said, smiling.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2052" data-line-end="2053">As they were about to walk away, Keith asked, “You said you bought the place, then who is Keith…”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2054" data-line-end="2055">“Ooh… that’s the previous owner. I am so busy, I had no time to change the name. I will change it by tomorrow.” Kristopher’s phone rang and he closed the door, saying bye to them.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2056" data-line-end="2057">Jay and Keith walked downstairs, and on their way down they saw Michelle and Jade, staring at the nameplate and writing something in the notebook.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2058" data-line-end="2059">“I think I know you… girl?” Keith pointed at Jade. “What are you girls doing here by the way?”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2060" data-line-end="2061">“Hi. I am Michelle and she is Jade. We were just searching for any person whose name starts with K,” Michelle said, shaking hands with Keith. She said all this in a single breath, without any hesitation.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2062" data-line-end="2063">“And why is that for?” Keith asked, confused.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2064" data-line-end="2065">Jade was about to say something but was interrupted by Michelle, “It is for our stats project… We may leave now… Nice to meet you guys.” She lied, she didn’t want more interaction. They both left until they got caught in the act of finding Mr. K.</p>
        <hr>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2067" data-line-end="2068">“Why we left… and why did you tell him that we are finding the person with K. You can tell him something,” Jade asked Michelle on their way back home.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2069" data-line-end="2070">“Sorry for revealing our plan… But I think that the Keith person… the name on the nameplate could be the killer.” Michelle made her deduction, she was unaware of KARAM or anything related to him.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2071" data-line-end="2072">“That Keith person is KARAM, and he is dead,” Jade replied.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2073" data-line-end="2074">“Oh, My… He is dead, or he made people think he is dead?” Michelle raised a complicated question.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2075" data-line-end="2077">“… I don’t know.” Jade got super confused.<br>
        Early Morning, there was a knock at the door of Williams’s apartment. Michelle opened the door seeing two known figures standing in front of her. They were Keith and Jay. Michelle had met them tomorrow.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2078" data-line-end="2079">“Hello…” Michelle greeted them, confused.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2080" data-line-end="2081">Jade was standing behind watching them talk.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2082" data-line-end="2083">“I am KARAM…” Keith entered the apartment without permission. Jay followed him. Michelle closed the door behind them, walked fast, and stood beside Jade.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2084" data-line-end="2085">“… I was thought to be the killer of Karia and now people think I am responsible for all the murders that happened. I can be the torturer but I am not a killer.” Keith continues.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2086" data-line-end="2087">“You were dead. I saw your funeral in the news.” Jade asked in confusion.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2088" data-line-end="2089">“Yaa. I was dead but this guy… my guardian angel… saved me.” Keith pointed at Jay, who was standing there, staring at all of them, clueless.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2090" data-line-end="2091">“And you.” Keith pointed towards Michelle.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2092" data-line-end="2093">“Yes… Mr. KARAM.” Michelle stammared.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2094" data-line-end="2095">“Call me Keith… How did you find the location for that K person?.. And don’t lie.”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2096" data-line-end="2097">“Ooo… I did some calculations from Mr. K’s. I am still not sure if that location is exact but it could be because we have found only a single person’s name that starts with K.” Michelle paused for a moment and then said to herself, “If I had more data I could be more exact.”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2098" data-line-end="2099">“Want to come with us? We can provide you data and you can provide us the location with your calculation or whatever you do.” Keith gave Michelle an offer.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2100" data-line-end="2101">“…I am not going anywhere without her.” Michelle tightly holds Jade’s arm.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2102" data-line-end="2103">“Why would I…” Jade said but no one listened.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2104" data-line-end="2105">“Come on girls…”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2106" data-line-end="2108">Michelle drags Jade with her. They both followed Keith and Jade.<br>
        All four of them drove to Maedrian’s house. This time Michelle knocked on the door.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2109" data-line-end="2110">“Hello…” Maedrian looked at the faces as she opened the door, it looks like she recognizes the faces except for Michelle’s.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2111" data-line-end="2112">Keith walked in without permission as usual, and all of them followed him. Inside the house, Keith gave Maedrian a tight hug. “It is so nice to meet you”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2113" data-line-end="2114">“I knew that you will be back soon.” Maedrian cries a little seeing Keith back.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2115" data-line-end="2116">“He is Jay… My savior. This is Michelle… the pathfinder lady and she is Jade… Karia’s elder sister.” Keith introduces all of them.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2117" data-line-end="2118">“I am not a pathfinder. I am a mathematician.” Michelle said out loud.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2119" data-line-end="2120">They all went to the living room. Keith ordered Maedrian to find someone named K-Vian who lives at his place for now. It is weird for her to find someone with this weird name. She knew that K means something. Maedrian started matching first names that start with K to the last name Vian. Soon she realizes something.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2121" data-line-end="2122">“I have to show you something, sir… Michelle can you pass me the card from that drawer.” Maedrian said to Michelle who is standing next to an old vintage bookshelf.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2123" data-line-end="2124">“Yaa… Sure.” Michelle searched for the card, took it, and walked towards her.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2125" data-line-end="2126">“See this…” She showed the card to Keith and Michelle who is now standing next to her. “It’s Kristopher J Vian.”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2127" data-line-end="2128">“Don’t confuse me guys… First, it is K-Vian. Now, it is J-Vian.” Michelle is clueless.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2129" data-line-end="2130">“It could be Jonathan. Kristopher Jonathan Vian. I know him. He is the lawyer.” Jade corrected her.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2131" data-line-end="2132">“Yes,” Maedrian said. “… An there is your address on his card.” She pointed at the address on the card in Keith’s hand.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2133" data-line-end="2135">Now it is just a matter of seconds till Mardrian and Michelle track his location but suddenly there’s a blast at the front door… Boom.<br>
        “I knew you wouldn’t give up on me so easily,” he said as he sat in the office, looking at Keith’s photo with great attention. “I’ve always had my eye on you. I didn’t mean to hurt you… but I can’t let anyone get in my way.” He stood up, put on his coat, and walked outside the office.</p>
        <hr>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2138" data-line-end="2139">Inside the ICU of the same hospital where Pamela and the others died, Michelle, Keith, and Mardrian lay on the beds being operated on after the blast. Jay and Jade stood outside in the hall, walking back and forth, keeping an eye on them.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2140" data-line-end="2141">For Jade and Jay, they were all dead, but soon the doctor walked out of the ICU and said, “There is no need to worry. They are all fine… But now it is a police case. You guys can take them after the police take their statements.”</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2142" data-line-end="2143">As the interrogation was ongoing, Officer Hector and Henna, who were taking the statements, received a message on their phones from an unknown number.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2144" data-line-end="2145">“Statement: They were getting in my way so I boomed them. I have no other personal issues with them. They are nice guys… and you two… take your clipboards and solve some other cases. You can’t stop me.”</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2146" data-line-end="2147">All of them, including Jay and Jade, who were now standing beside Keith, were shocked by this whole scenario.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2148" data-line-end="2149">“How can someone know so much about us?” Jay whispered to himself.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2150" data-line-end="2151">“… Or he might be somewhere around us?” Keith completed the sentence.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2152" data-line-end="2153">“He is that lawyer guy…Kristopher.” Maedrian said in a very low tone, she is in pain from the blast.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2154" data-line-end="2155">Michelle walked towards the police. The blast didn’t touch her. She said, “We are just assuming. Even if we are right we can’t do anything to him. As she said… He is a lawyer and he knew how to get away with this whole mess. We have to prove him guilty.”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2156" data-line-end="2157">“… And how are we going to do this,” Jay asked, curiously.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2158" data-line-end="2159">“We just have to track him down in the same distance in all four directions. According to my calculations, he never leaves his territory.” Michelle said, trembling.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2160" data-line-end="2161">“What is this boundary?” Hector asked. confused.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2162" data-line-end="2163">“There you go. I have circled the area.” Michelle showed him the screenshot of the map on her phone.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2164" data-line-end="2165">“I know this place… It’s KARAM who is doing all this again. He is not dead.” Hector was shocked seeing the location marked x. He doesn’t know the person on the bed in front of him is KARAM himself, and no one told him that.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2166" data-line-end="2167">“I worked with KARAM. He never killed anyone.” Maedrian confirms.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2168" data-line-end="2169">“He took Karia’s life. He shot Martha. I am sure that he is doing all this…” Henna finally spoke, She hated KARAM a lot.</p>
        <hr>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2172" data-line-end="2173">Inside Kristopher’s office, a girl is sitting in front of him. It’s Martha. “Thanks, Kris. Here is your rest of the money.” She passed him the money in a brown envelope with cash and walked away.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2174" data-line-end="2175">“See you soon.” He said on her way out.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2176" data-line-end="2177">“Hope not.”</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2178" data-line-end="2179">Two days later. Inside Keith’s safe house. The whole place is designed like a botanical garden, everything is set up to his liking. Keith never knew that someday he will be back in this place, the place he and Sapphira made as a sign of their love.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2180" data-line-end="2181">“I have a question?” Michelle asked everyone, pacing back and forth.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2182" data-line-end="2183">“Confused nerd… what’s the question?” Keith smiled.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2184" data-line-end="2185">“Is everyone here good with technology or is this K person too smart?” Michelle asked, fixing her glasses.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2186" data-line-end="2187">“What does that question suppose to mean?” Keith asked, trying to make sense of the question.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2188" data-line-end="2189">“Kristopher is a smart guy but there might be someone helping him with the technical stuff… or he is not what we thought he is. Some people do have multi-talents.” Maedrian said.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2190" data-line-end="2191">Ding. Keith got a message from an unknown number.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2192" data-line-end="2193">“Dear Mr. KARAM, I just want to tell you one thing. Stop… getting… in… my… way.”</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2194" data-line-end="2195">“How did he get anyone’s number?” Keith raised an amazing question.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2196" data-line-end="2197">“He’s a lawyer. He might have access to the records… or there might be a hacker who is helping him.” Maedrian replied, confused.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2198" data-line-end="2199">Michelle’s question got everyone wondering how a lawyer could know so much about device controlling, and hunting down people kind of stuff. It is for sure that there is a hundred percent someone that is helping him with that stuff.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2200" data-line-end="2201">“Sir… I think someone hacked into my laptop. Some folders are missing.” Maedrian got shocked to see her laptop being hacked. “Now I got this. He or his helper used me. I need to do something fast.”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2202" data-line-end="2203">“How could you be so careless.” Keith scolded her.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2204" data-line-end="2205">“I am so sorry sir”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2206" data-line-end="2207">Michelle stood still near the window, now staring at Maedrian. “There is something fishy.” She thought.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2208" data-line-end="2210">Maedrian attempted to hack into the security cameras around Lime Street, Boston to keep an eye on Kristopher’s daily routine. Despite her efforts, she found nothing out of the ordinary in Kristopher’s daily routine. Every day seems to be a repeat of the previous day, with Kristopher following the same pattern of behavior.<br>
        It appeared as though there was nothing to be found that can prove Kristopher to be the killer. It was like there were on a wild goose chase.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2211" data-line-end="2212">A moment later Michelle said, “He is Kristopher… but he didn’t change the name plate of the house… and their nothing weird in his daily routine. There is something wrong with this.”</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2213" data-line-end="2214">“What’s wrong now?” Everyone asked.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2215" data-line-end="2216">“Aah…” after a long pause, Michelle said, “I will say this to Keith in person.”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2217" data-line-end="2218">They both went inside the corner room of the safe house to talk.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2219" data-line-end="2220">“I think it’s Jay or Maedrian who is passing the information to Mr.K or not giving us the whole information. I have noticed… they both are acting a bit weird.” Michelle whispered.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2221" data-line-end="2222">“Why not Jade?” He asked.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2223" data-line-end="2224">“After her sister’s death, she wants to stay away from this whole mess. She can’t plan this tricky thing.”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2225" data-line-end="2227">“I think you could be right about this.” Keith squinted.<br>
        “Guys… You all have to leave. Everything is fine for now.” Keith said, walking out of the room.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2228" data-line-end="2229">“But sir…” Maedrian tries to say something but is interrupted by Keith.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2230" data-line-end="2231">“No more questions. We will have a meeting soon… The cab is waiting for you around the corner. ”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2232" data-line-end="2233">The very next day, morning at 9:00 AM. Kieth knocked on the door of Att. Kristopher.  “Come in.” a sound came from inside. Keith entered inside with the hope of finally ending this all. It was a small cozy office. Keith saw him working on his laptop.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2234" data-line-end="2235">“Hello, Mr. Keith… or I say Mr. KARAM,” Kristopher said, now focused on Keith. “Please sit down… What do you prefer… coffee or tea?” He asked with a polite smile.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2236" data-line-end="2237">They both know what they both were here for.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2238" data-line-end="2239">“I am here to end what you had started,” Keith said, sitting down.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2240" data-line-end="2241">“And how would you do that?.. Are you gonna go to the police and say I did all this? Go ahead do it.” Kristopher stood up and walked toward where Keith is sitting. “…I know you came all the way here for my confession… Yes… I did kill them all. But you can’t prove anything… and you can’t stop me.”</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2242" data-line-end="2243">Keith got boiling red, “I will make you regret what you did to all of them.”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2244" data-line-end="2245">“I would be thrilled to see that. Go on… do your best…” Kristopher said to him as he saw Keith stand up from the chair and about to walk out. “… But wait. I have to show you something.” He played a live video on the TV screen.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2246" data-line-end="2247">In this video, Keith saw Jade, Michelle, and Maedrian tied to the chair with their mouths covered so when they try to scream, which they were doing, so no one could listen to them.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2248" data-line-end="2249">“Not again,” Keith said to himself. He stood up and grabbed Kristopher by the collar. “If anything happened to them. I am gonna kill you myself.”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2250" data-line-end="2252">During the argument Keith saw Michelle trying to say something with her eyes, it was Morse code. J.A.Y. She was continuously doing it, she knew that if this video goes public police or Keith would decode this message.<br>
        After hearing Keith’s words, everyone sat in the cab and went home, but on the way, Jay pulled out a gun and shot the driver without a second thought, and pulled the hand brakes.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2253" data-line-end="2254">“Get out, everyone.” He ordered everyone out of the vehicle at gunpoint.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2255" data-line-end="2256">The weather was clear and there was no one around there for their help. Jay had a good chance to shoot and bury these three girls, but he had something else on his mind. He was working for Mr. K. These three girls are becoming a headache in Mr. K’s plans. The purpose of keeping them all alive was to keep control over Keith’s actions and to show his power.</p>
        <hr>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2259" data-line-end="2260">Keith had no idea that he would get into such trouble, why did the one who saved his life betray him so badly?</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2261" data-line-end="2262">“Now even living has become death for me…” Keith said to himself, walking on the footpath. “I want to find that bastard.”. Keith remembers that video again after some time passed.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2263" data-line-end="2264">When Michelle was blinking, trying to give a message in Morse code, there was a bell sound in the background. There was no other sound. Keith remembered the time when he captured the girls in a warehouse. There are many warehouses near the church in Boston but all of them had all the other sounds with the church bell, except for one. Keith decided to test his luck and make his way to the warehouse.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2265" data-line-end="2267">Inside the empty warehouse, he saw three empty chairs. Keith digs deep to search more for some clues. He went to the edge of the warehouse where there was a tiny room with no door. There, he heard someone trying to move but as he stepped inside, an unknown hand hit his head from behind. Keith falls down on the ground, seeing a manly figure.<br>
        Keith, Michelle, Jade, and Maedrian were now tied to the chair and placed two on each side in front of each other—Jade with Keith and Michelle with Maedrian.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2268" data-line-end="2269">A male figure which Keith saw was Jay. Jay walks right in front of them with evil laughter. Pointing the gun toward Keith he said, “You guys are so stupid. You shouldn’t get in Kristopher’s way.” He took a pause and walked closer to Michelle, “… Now you all have to die.”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2270" data-line-end="2271">“Not on my watch.” A woman shouts from behind.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2272" data-line-end="2273">Keith recognizes the voice. It’s Martha. She came all the way from the prison to save the. Martha found out that Mr. K is going to create a huge mess when he showed him the wrong broken laptop. She knew that Kristopher can use that laptop against her but she was willing to take the risk in the hope to do something before she dies or goes back to prison.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2274" data-line-end="2275">Bang… Bang. Jay started shooting at her but missed every shot.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2276" data-line-end="2277">“Aah, you kid.” Martha took a straight headshot. Jay falls motionless on the ground.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2278" data-line-end="2279">“This girl has quite nice aim,” Jade spoke.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2280" data-line-end="2281">“Why all criminals like warehouses too much for this killing stuff…” Michelle stammered.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2282" data-line-end="2283">“Now can you free us all?” Keith said to Martha.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2284" data-line-end="2285">Martha frees them all and orders them to run away. “I am going to handle this mess. You guys just leave.”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2286" data-line-end="2287">“You guys go.” Keith ordered them, “I am not leaving you here.” Keith said to Martha. Keith and Martha argued while Maedrian took all of them out of the warehouse.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2288" data-line-end="2301">The clock ticked loudly in the room’s silence as Venta clutched the gun in her shaking hand. Martha and KARAM stood before her, unaware of the impending danger. Suddenly, without warning, Venta pulled the trigger, mercilessly shooting both Martha and KARAM. Blood splattered around as their bodies crumpled to the ground.<br>
        Venta quickly dialed the police from a burner phone, her voice severe and cold as she reported the crime. She walked away from the scene, her footsteps echoing in the empty warehouse. Her face was etched with a serious expression as if she was being controlled by a force beyond her control.<br>
        As the police arrived at the scene, they were met with the gruesome sight of two bleeding bodies lying on the floor. Venta’s whereabouts remained unknown for so long.<br>
        KARAM’s identity was identified at that moment, and her body was taken for embalming.<br>
        Jay Hodges, the skilled embalmer, approached the body of Keith Andrew with a heavy heart. As he examined the lifeless form, a bullet wound on the forehead caught his attention. But to his surprise, there was no bullet to be found inside the skull. A glimmer of hope sparked within Jay as he thought of a daring plan to save Keith’s life.<br>
        With only a few hours left until the burial, Jay knew he had to act fast. He quickly set to work, using his knowledge of movies to create makeshift defibrillators from metal plates. His hands shook as he applied the first shock to Keith’s heart, but nothing happened.<br>
        Determined to save his patient, Jay tried again, this time with more force. Still, there was no response. With only one last chance left, Jay took a deep breath and delivered the final shock. To his amazement, Keith’s heart started to beat once more.<br>
        Jay Hodges had successfully brought Keith back from the brink of death.<br>
        It was about an hour left till the funeral van came to take the body for the burial process. Keith and Jay had to do something before the situation slips out of hand.<br>
        “We have to find a body the same as me,” Keith suggested.<br>
        They both went out on the hunt for a body and with a luck, they found an abandoned corpse of the same height. There is only one problem, the abandoned corpse doesn’t look like Keith, not even ten percent.<br>
        “People hate you. They don’t want to see your face.” Jay said to Keith as he was staring at the body, “… But I can make it look like you.” Jay is confident about his job.<br>
        “I know people hate me. But we have to do something. I am a villain for them. They will kill me if they found out I am not dead… Just make him look like me.”.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2302" data-line-end="2303">From that day someone is resting underground under the name of Keith Andrew Ravera Antonio Martine.</p>
